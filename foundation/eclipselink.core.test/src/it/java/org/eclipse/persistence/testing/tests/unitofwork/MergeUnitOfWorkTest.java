/**
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose</b>: This test checks if UOW merge is perfromed properly.
 * <p>
 * <b>Motivation </b>: This test was written to fix a bug. While in a unit of work, a new
 * object that refrenced clones, after the merge still refrenced clones.
 * <p>
 * <b>Design</b>: A unit of work is acquired, an employee is read in and registered to the UOW. The
 * returned clone is stored. A new employee is created, parts of the new employee are initialized
 * with parts of the clone. A commit is issued. After the commit is done, the merge should
 * have replaced the clones in the new employee with the original objects that were cloned.
 * This is verified.
 * <p>
 * <b>Responsibilities</b>: Verify that the merge works properly. Make sure that the original objects
 * are pointed to by the new employee.
 * <p>
 * <b>Features Used</b>: Unit Of Work, Merge feature
 * <p>
 * <b>Paths Covered</b>: Within the unit of work, different parts of the employee were set with clones:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <i>Address</i> 1:1 Mapping
 * <li> <i>Period</i> Simple Aggregate
 * <li> <i>NormalHours</i>
