/**
 *  Test for bug 3324757 REDIRECT QUERY RESULTS DO NOT CONFORM TO A UNITOFWORK
 *  <p>
 *  This was a bug with the old query design.  The problem was a UnitOfWork
 *  would send the query to the parent, and the parent would execute the
 *  redirected query.
 *  <p>
 *  If the query was a conforming query, then conforming would fail as outside
 *  UnitOfWork.
