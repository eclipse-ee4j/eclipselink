/**
 * <p><b>Purpose</b>: Represent a employee of an organization.
 * <p><b>Description</b>: An Employee is a root object in the Employee Demo.
 * It maintains relationships to all of the other objects in the system.
 * The employee shows usage of 1-1, 1-m, m-m, aggregate and transformation mappings.
 * The employee also shows usage of value holder to implement indirection for its relationships
 * (note, it is strongly suggested to always use value holders for relationships).
