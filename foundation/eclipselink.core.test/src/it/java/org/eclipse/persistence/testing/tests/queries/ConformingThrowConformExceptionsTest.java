 * bug 3570561: CONFORMING QUERY THROWS INDIRECTION EXCEPTION EVEN WHEN ALL IND. TRIGGERED
 * <p>
 * In this bug, if a user set shouldThrowConformExceptions, we were still
 * throwing an indirection exception, even though conforming is smart enough to
 * do something else in this case.
 * <p>
 * It is API that got removed from sessions.UnitOfWork.
