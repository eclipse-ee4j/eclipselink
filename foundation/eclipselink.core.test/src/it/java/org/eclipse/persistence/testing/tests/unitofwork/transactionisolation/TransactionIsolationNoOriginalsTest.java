/**
 * Tests the Session read refactoring / reading through the write connection
 * properly feature.
 * <p>
 * This test verifies that originals of objects read by a UnitOfWork in early
 * transaction are not placed in the shared cache until commit/merge time.
 * <p>
 * If the object is not registered in the UnitOfWork, you would think it would
 * be safe to put the original in the shared cache, for if not registered must
 * not have changed it.  However this feature is being quite particular about
 * not putting anything in the shared cache, even if we are pretty sure we can
 * get away with it.  I.e. maybe they executed a direct no select and messed up
 * some rows, even though we haven't registered anything yet.
