/**
 * Tests the Session read refactoring / reading through the write connection
 * properly feature.
 * <p>
 * Now that we can trigger valueholders directly by executing a query on the
 * UnitOfWork, an obvious question is what happens when the query is automatically
 * a conformming query?
 * <p>
 * It seems ideal that when you delete an address and then go employee.getAddress()
 * you get back null.  I.e. conforming is done on the indirection.  However
 * it is not good in that the clone==backup, so merge will not update the
 * shared cache version.
 * <p>
 * Or maybe it is safe, but do we want to do a full conforming when triggering
 * a valueholder?  That could slow things down significantly.  And also we
 * will only do this when in transaction, which is not consistent at all.
