/**
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose</b>: This test checks if UOW merge is perfromed properly.
 * <p>
 * <b>Motivation </b>: This test was written to fix a bug. While in a unit of work, a new
 * object that refrenced clones, after the merge still refrenced clones.
 * <p>
 * <b>Design</b>: implement an equals method for objects that always returns true, and in another object
 * implement an equals that always returns false. Now check the four paths mentioned below by
 * registering the two objects into the UOW, compare the clones returned. If the two objects are
 * different (regardless of what they think) then different clones must be returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Responsibilities</b>: Verify that the registration of the objects does not depend on the equals method
 * <p>
 * <b>Features Used</b>: Unit Of Work, Registering feature
 * <p>
 * <b>Paths Covered</b>: Within the unit of work, different parts of the employee were set with clones:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i> Think they are equal but are unequal, clones are different
 * <li> Think they are equal and are equal, clones are identical
 * <li> Think they are unequal but are equal, clones are identical
 * <li> Think they are unequal and are unequal, clones are different </i>
