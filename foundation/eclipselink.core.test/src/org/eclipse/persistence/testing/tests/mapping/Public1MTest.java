/**
 * <P>
 * <B>Purpose</B>: This test tests deleting an object with public parts, and ensures that
 * the public parts are not deleted as well.<P>
 *
 * <B>Motivation</B>: If an object has several public parts (in this example, an Employee manages
 * several other Employees), the public parts should not be deleted when the owner is deleted (if
 * the manager is fired and deleted from the database, all the employees he/she managed should not
 * be deleted).<P>
 *
 * <B>Design</B>: In this model, each <CODE>Employee</CODE> has a <CODE>manager</CODE>, and has
 * a collection of <CODE>managedEmployees</CODE>.  In the test, an Employee is read in, and his
 * <CODE>managedEmployee</CODE> collection is saved.  The Manger is then deleted, and the test
 * then verifies that none of the Employees in <CODE>managedEmployee</CODE> was deleted.<P>
 *
 * <B>Responsibilities</B>: Ensure that public parts are not deleted with their parent.<P>
 *
 * <B>Features Used</B>:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>Public 1:M mapping
 * </UL>
 *
 * <B>Paths Covered</B>: The following conversions are made:
 * <UL>
 *        <LI><CODE>Employee</CODE> with multiple <CODE>managedEmployees</CODE> is deleted from the
 *        database.
 * </UL>
