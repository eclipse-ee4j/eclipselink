/**
 * Tests the Session read refactoring / reading through the write connection
 * properly feature.
 * <p>
 * Tests the interaction of the ComplexQueryResult / shouldIncludeData feature
 * and executing queries on the UnitOfWork.
 * <p>
 * For many to many must return the EMP_ID/PROJ_ID rows from the relation table
 * in addition to the batch objects so we can figure out which projects belong
 * to which employees.  This is done with query.setShouldIncludeData(true).
 * <p>
 * However, the implementation of shouldIncludeData is scary, for if anyone
 * else touches the query result except those expecting it (i.e. a UnitOfWork
 * trying to register it) TopLink will be die.
