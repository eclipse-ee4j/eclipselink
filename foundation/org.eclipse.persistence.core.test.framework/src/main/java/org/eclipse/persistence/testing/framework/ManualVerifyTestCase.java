 * Setup: Performs all the initial setup that is required by the test, such as setting

 * Test: The actual test to be performed, such as writing an object.
 * Verify: Verify the test if it was performed well or not.
 * Reset: Reset the database to the state from where the test started
 * Reset Verify: Check if reset performed well or not.
