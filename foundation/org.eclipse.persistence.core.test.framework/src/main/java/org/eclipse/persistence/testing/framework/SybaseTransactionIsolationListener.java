 * According to http://manuals.sybase.com/onlinebooks/group-as/asg1250e/sqlug/@Generic__BookTextView/53713;pt=52735/*
 * The SQL92 standard defines four levels of isolation for transactions.
 * Each isolation level specifies the kinds of actions that are not permitted while concurrent transactions are executing.
 * Higher levels include the restrictions imposed by the lower levels:
 *
 * Level 0 - ensures that data written by one transaction represents the actual data.
 * It prevents other transactions from changing data that has already been modified
 * (through an insert, delete, update, and so on) by an uncommitted transaction.
 * The other transactions are blocked from modifying that data until the transaction commits.
 * However, other transactions can still read the uncommitted data, which results in dirty reads.
 *
 * Level 1 - prevents dirty reads.
 * Such reads occur when one transaction modifies a row, and a second transaction reads that row before the first transaction commits the change.
 * If the first transaction rolls back the change, the information read by the second transaction becomes invalid.
 * This is the default isolation level supported by Adaptive Server.
 * ....
 *
 * Apparently Sybase versions 12.5 and 15 has Level 1 set as default.
 * That causes several tests to hang: these tests begin transaction, update a row,
 * then (before the transaction has been committed) attempt to read the row through another connection.
 *
 * To allow these reads to go through (and read the uncommitted data) connection isolation level
 * should be temporary switched to Level 0.
 *
 * This class switches the acquired connection to Level 0 and then sets back the original isolation level before connection is released.
 *
 * Note that for the above scenario only read connection require Level 0.
 *
 * This solution works only on Sybase 15 but fails on Sybase 12.5 with:
 * com.sybase.jdbc3.jdbc.SybSQLException: The optimizer could not find a unique index which it could use to perform an isolation level 0 scan on table 'RESPONS'.
