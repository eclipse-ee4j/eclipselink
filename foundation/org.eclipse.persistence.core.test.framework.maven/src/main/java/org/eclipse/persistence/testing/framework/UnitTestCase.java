/**
 * <b>Purpose:</b> Allow for very simple Unit tests.
 *
 * The drawback with the current test framework is that because each test case
 * corresponds 1-1 to a java class, in the worst case there will be one java
 * class for each test case.
 * <p>
 * This can be alleviated by writing generic test cases, (i.e. that take many
 * parameters), or in the worst case testing many things with a single test
 * case / java class.  The latter is messy and the former works well with
 * functional tests (where you can execute the same code but in different
 * ways), but is fairly useless when it comes to Unit testing.  How for example
 * can one write a generic test case for testing getters and setters?
 * <p>
 * A unit test can be added to any TestSuite, and works well when setup/reset is
 * extremely simple or not required, and the test method itself is only a couple
 * of lines long.  In this case the entire test itself is just a method in
 * that TestSuite, named _test{TestName}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b> To add a test called CreateTest, to test Expression.create(),
 * define a method called _testCreateTest in ExpressionUnitTestSuite,
 * and in addTests call:
 *     addTest(new UnitTestCase("CreateTest"));
 * When the test is executed ExpressionUnitTestSuite setup() and reset()
 * will be called, along with _testCreateTest().
 *
