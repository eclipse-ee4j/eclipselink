/**
 * HashPartitioning partitions access to a database cluster by the hash of a field value from the object,
 * such as the object's location, or tenant.
 * The hash indexes into the list of connection pools.
 * All write or read request for object's with that hash value are sent to the server.
 * If a query does not include the field as a parameter, then it can either be sent
 * to all server's and unioned, or left to the sesion's default behavior.
 * <p>
 * Partitioning can be enabled on an Entity, relationship, query, or session/persistence unit.
 * Partition policies are globally named to allow reuse,
 * the partitioning policy must also be set using the @Partitioned annotation to be used.
