/**
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose</b>: Detects new members of a logical EclipseLink cluster.
 * <p>
 * <b>Description</b>: Each RemoteCommandManager has its own DiscoveryManager,
 * which handles the detection of other remote command services as they become available.
 * The DiscoveryManager is an active object (in that it extends Thread) and becomes
 * a separate thread when it is started using startDiscovery().
 * <p>
 * Discovery is done through the use of a multicast. Each discovery manager
 * joins the multicast group and announces itself to the group. As it receives
 * service announcements from other discovery managers it notifies the RCM to
 * establish connections to and from the new service.
