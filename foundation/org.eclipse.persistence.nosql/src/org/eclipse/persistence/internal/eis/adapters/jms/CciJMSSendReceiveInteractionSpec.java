/**
 * INTERNAL:
 * Interaction spec for JMS JCA adapter.
 *
 * Specifies a send/receive message interaction.  It is assumed here that the entity
 * processing the request sets the JMSCorrelationID on the response message to be
 * either the JMSCorrelationID of the request message (if non-null) or the
 * JMSMessageID of the request message (if the JMSCorrelationID is null).  This allows
 * for the user to define the correlation id to link the request/response messages if
 * they wish.
 *
 * Since we are doing a send/receive in one interaction, we know that the replyTo value
 * indicates the response queue as well.
