/**
 * Test for feature 2612601: conforming without registering in the Unit Of Work.
 * The test must insure the following things:
 *    -Conforming still works, even though objects are not being registered.
 *    -Objects returned by a conforming without registering query
 *    are in fact not being registered.
 *    -Registered objects never point to unregistered objects, and vice versa.
 *    -An unregistered object can later be safely registered.
 *
 * Test plan:
 *    -First execute two queries on the session: all employees whose address is
 *    in Ontario, and the complement.
 *    -Register employee 1 and change his address to outside Ontario.
 *    -Register employee 2's address and change it to outside Ontario.
 *    -Register employee 3 from outside Ontario and change address to Ontario.
 *
 *    At this point there are three registered addresses, and two registered
 *    employees.
 *
 *    If the same query is now executed again on the Unit of Work, conforming
 *    without registering, the following results should be expected:
 *
 *    -employee 1 will be returned from database, but on conform it will be
 *    replaced with its clone, which points to an address outside Ontario.  So
 *    it will be dropped.
 *
 *    -employee 2 will be returned from database, and since it was not registered
 *    will be returned automatically.  This is a limitation from bug 2675667:
 *    CONFORMING QUERIES MISS RESULTS NEWLY CONFORMING TO YET UNREGISTERED IN UOW.
 *
 *    -employee 3 will not be returned from database, but it will be added in
 *    later, as its address does conform.
 *
 *    -Even though the query was run on a unit of work, no additional employees
 *    or addresses were registered.
 *
 *    -Though employee 2's cloned address was used to conform, employee 2 does
 *    not point to the cloned address and vice versa.
 *
 *    Test Limitations:
 *
 *    -Only a single simple query was tested.  Employee to address is a one to
 *    one mapping, and there is only a single join.
 *
 *    -Employee 2 has an address outside of Ontario, but is returned by the
 *    conforming query.  This is a limitation from bug 2675667:
 *    CONFORMING QUERIES MISS RESULTS NEWLY CONFORMING TO YET UNREGISTERED IN UOW.
 *    Better to not work at all then sometimes.
