/**
 * Tests the Session read refactoring / reading through the write connection
 * properly feature.
 * <p>
 * Tests the interaction of building clones from rows in transaction and
 * the descriptor setting alwaysRefreshIdentityMapResult.
 * <p>
 * Two things could have gone wrong.  a) since this only refreshes the originals
 * we might do nothing and not refresh, since we skip all that original only code.
 * b) we refresh the originals from the write connection.
 * <p>
 * The combination of these two features provide perfect support for transaction
 * isolation.  If in transaction and no original in cache, will not put one in.
 * If always refreshing will never use what is in there, for we would have to
 * refresh it from a dirty row.  However objects are still put in the shared
 * cache after commit, and read object queries can get cache hits without
 * checking if always refresh is true.
 * <p>
 * The only question is whether a cache hit can succeed if set to always refresh
