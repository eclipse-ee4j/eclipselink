        <blockquote>

            <p>The EclipseLink Project includes ASM for the purpose of
                byte code weaving. The AMS library is re-packaged within the source of the
                project (org.persistence.eclipse.internal.libraries.asm.*) to avoid version
                collisions with other usage of ASM.
            </p>
            <p>The source code is available within the project's git repository and the
                org.eclipse.persistence.asm.source_*.jar bundle.
                The binaries are distributed within the eclipselink.jar and in the org.eclipse.persistence.asm_*.jar
                bundle. </p>
