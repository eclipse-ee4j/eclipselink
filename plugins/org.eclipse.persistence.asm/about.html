<h3><a name="ASM" id="ASM"></a>ASM v3.3.1 </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The EclipseLink Project includes ASM for the purpose of 
    byte code weaving. The AMS library is re-packaged within the source of the 
    project (org.persistence.eclipse.internal.libraries.asm.*) to avoid version 
    collisions with other usage of ASM. 
  </p>
  <p>The source code is available within the project's subversion repository. 
    The binaries are distributed within the eclipselink.jar and in the org.eclipse.persistence.asm_*.jar 
    bundle. </p>
