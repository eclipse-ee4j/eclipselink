<P>The <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink">EclipseLink</A> project
    includes ASM for the purpose of byte code weaving. The ASM library is
    re-packaged within the source of the
    project (org.persistence.eclipse.internal.libraries.asm.*) to avoid version
    collisions with other usage of ASM.
  </p>
  <p>The source code is available within the org.eclipse.persistence.asm.source_*.jar
      bundle and the project's git repository. The binaries are distributed within the
    eclipselink.jar and in the org.eclipse.persistence.asm_*.jar bundle. </p>
