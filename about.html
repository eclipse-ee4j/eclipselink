<h1>EclipseLink 2.0.0</h1>
<p>Dec 10th, 2009</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink">EclipseLink</a> project's 
  goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive 
  and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects 
  to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML. 
  EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced 
  feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data 
  source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML 
  Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services 
  (DBWS). </p>

<h3><a name="ASM" id="ASM"></a>ASM v1.5.3 </h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The EclipseLink Project includes ASM for the purpose of 
    byte code weaving. The AMS library is re-packaged within the source of the 
    project (org.persistence.eclipse.internal.libraries.asm.*) to avoid version 
    collisions with other usage of ASM. A custom patch has been added to the ASM 
    1.5.3 source to handle an issue with other usages. This fix has 
    also been contributed back to the ASM project for inclusion in later projects. 
  </p>
  <p>The source code is available within the project's subversion repository. 
    The binaries are distributed within the eclipselink.jar and in the org.eclipse.persistence.asm_2.0.0.v*.jar 
    bundle. </p>
