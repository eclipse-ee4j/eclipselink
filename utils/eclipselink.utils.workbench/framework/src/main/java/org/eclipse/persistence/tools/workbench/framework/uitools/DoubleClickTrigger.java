/**
 * This class is used for detecting the occurence of a double-click. For the
 * purposes of this class, a "double-click" is the occurence of two
 * {@link MouseEvent}s corresponding to the mouse1 button without any modifier
 * keys being pressed.
 * <p>
 * The detection of double-click is mediated by the {@link #isDoubleClick(MouseEvent)}
 * method. All mouse events for a particular {@link java.awt.event.MouseListener
 * MouseListener} must be forwarded to {@link #isDoubleClick(MouseEvent)} for
 * processing in order for the proper sequence of clicks to be detected.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of {@link #isDoubleClick(MouseEvent)} is somewhat
 * unforgiving, since it will return <CODE>true</CODE> only when the click count
 * is a multiple of 2, so long as the last two clicks were mouse1 clicks without
 * modifier keys.
