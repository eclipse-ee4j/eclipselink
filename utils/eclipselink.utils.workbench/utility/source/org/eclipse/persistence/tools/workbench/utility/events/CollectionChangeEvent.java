/**
 * A "CollectionChange" event gets delivered whenever a model changes a "bound"
 * or "constrained" collection. A CollectionChangeEvent object is sent as an
 * argument to the CollectionChangeListener.
 *
 * Normally a CollectionChangeEvent is accompanied by the collection name and
 * the items that were added to or removed from the changed collection.
 *
 * Design options:
 * - create a collection to wrap a single added or removed item
 *     (this is the option we implemented below and in collaborating code)
 *     since there is no way to optimize downstream code for
 *     single items, we take another performance hit by building
 *     a collection each time  (@see Collections.singleton(Object))
 *     and forcing downstream code to use an iterator every time
 *
 * - create a separate event for each item added or removed
 *     eliminates any potential for optimizations to downstream code
 *
 * - add protocol to support both single items and collections
 *     adds conditional logic to downstream code
