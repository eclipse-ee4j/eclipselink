#Library specific manifest entries
# Note: manifest lines can contain a maximum of 71 characters of data
#       longer lines must be continued on the line below by starting
#       the line with a single space. This makes defining things like
#       classpaths VERY interesting, because property files are parsed
#       line by line. So theoretically special characters need to be
#       inserted to get the multiple specs to play nice, however, in
#       practice it doesn't work.
