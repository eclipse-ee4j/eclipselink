        <h2>About This Content</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://eclipse.dev/eclipselink/">EclipseLink</a> project's
            goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive
            and universal. It runs in any Java environment and reads and writes objects
            to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML.
            EclipseLink focuses on providing leading edge support, including advanced
            feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data
            source; Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Jakarta XML
            Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services
            (DBWS). </p>
