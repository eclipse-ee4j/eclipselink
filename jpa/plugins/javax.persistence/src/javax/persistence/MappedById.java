 * This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the

/**
 * The MappedById annotation is used to designate a ManyToOne or OneToOne
 * relationship attribute that corresponds to an EmbeddedId primary key, an
 * attribute within an EmbeddedId primary key, or a simple primary key of the
 * parent entity. The value attribute specifies the attribute within a composite
 * key to which the relationship attribute corresponds. If the entity's primary
 * key is of the same Java type as the primary key of the entity referenced by
 * the relationship, the value attribute is not specified.
