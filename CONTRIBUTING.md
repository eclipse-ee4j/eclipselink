# Contributing to EclipseLink

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The EclipseLink project's goal is to provide a complete persistence solution
that is both comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment
and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including
relational databases, XML, or EIS systems. EclipseLink will focus on providing
leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant
persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA)
for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Java
Connector Architecture (JCA) for EIS and other types of legacy systems, and
Service Data Objects (SDO).
