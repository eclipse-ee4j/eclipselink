# EclipseLink

The EclipseLink project's goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both
comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects
to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, XML, JSON, or EIS systems.
EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions,
for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source;
Jakarta Persistence for relational databases, Jakarta XML Binding for XML,
Jakarta Connectors for EIS and other types of legacy systems, and Service Data Objects (SDO).
