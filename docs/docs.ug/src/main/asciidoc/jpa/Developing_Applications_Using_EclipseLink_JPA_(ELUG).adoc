== Using Application Components

When developing an application with EclipseLink JPA, you need to know
how to use the following application components:

* link:#How_to_Obtain_an_Entity_Manager_Factory[Entity manager factory]
* link:#How_to_Obtain_an_Entity_Manager[Entity manager]
* link:#How_to_Use_a_Persistence_Context[Persistence context]

=== How to Obtain an Entity Manager Factory

How you obtain the entity manager factory depends on the Java
environment in which you are developing your application:

* link:#Obtaining_an_Entity_Manager_Factory_in_Java_EE_Application_Server_Environment[Obtaining
an Entity Manager Factory in Java EE Application Server Environment]
* link:#Obtaining_an_Entity_Manager_Factory_in_Java_SE_Environment[Obtaining
an Entity Manager Factory in Java SE Environment]

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in Java EE Application Server Environment

You can inject an entity manager factory using the `+@PersistenceUnit+`
annotation, as the following example shows, or you can obtain it through
JNDI lookup. You may choose to specify the `+unitName+` element to
designate the persistence unit whose factory you are using.

`+@PersistenceUnit+` `+EntityManagerFactory emf;+`

For more information, see the following:

* Section 8.4.2 "`PersistenceUnit Annotation`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* Section 5.3.1 "`Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in a Java EE
Container`" of the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA
Specification]
* link:Introduction%20to%20Java%20Persistence%20API%20(ELUG)#Container-Managed_Entity_Manager[Container-Managed
Entity Manager]

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in Java SE Environment

In Java SE environment, use the `+javax.persistence.Persistence+`
bootstrap class to get access to an entity manager factory. In your
application, create an entity manager factory by calling the
`+javax.persistence.Persistence+` class’ `+createEntityManagerFactory+`
method (see Section 7.2.1 "`javax.persistence.Persistence Class`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]), as the
following example shows:

[source,java]
----
 EntityManagerFactory emf = javax.persistence.Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("Order");
 EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
----

For more information, see the following:

* Section 7.2.1 "`javax.persistence.Persistence Class`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* Section 5.3.2 "`Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in a Java SE
Container`" of the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA
Specification]
* link:Introduction%20to%20Java%20Persistence%20API%20(ELUG)#Application-Managed_Entity_Manager[Application-Managed
Entity Manager]

=== How to Obtain an Entity Manager

All entity managers come from factories of type
`+EntityManagerFactory+`. The configuration for an entity manager is
bound to the `+EntityManagerFactory+` that created it, but it is defined
separately as a persistence unit. A persistence unit dictates either
implicitly or explicitly the settings and entity classes used by all
entity managers obtained from the unique `+EntityManagerFactory+`
instance bound to that persistence unit. There is, therefore, a
one-to-one correspondence between a persistence unit and its concrete
`+EntityManagerFactory+`.Persistence units are named to allow
differentiation of one `+EntityManagerFactory+` from another. This gives
the application control over which configuration or persistence unit is
to be used for operating on a particular entity.

How you obtain the entity manager and its factory depends on the Java
environment in which you are developing your application:

* link:#Obtaining_an_Entity_Manager_in_Java_EE_Application_Server_Environment[Obtaining
an Entity Manager in Java EE Application Server Environment]
* link:#Obtaining_an_Entity_Manager_in_Java_SE_Environment[Obtaining an
Entity Manager in Java SE Environment]

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager in Java EE Application Server Environment

In the Java EE environment, you can inject an entity manager using the
`+@PersistenceContext+` annotation, as the following example shows, or
you can obtain it through a direct JNDI lookup. You may choose to
specify the `+unitName+` element of the `+@PersistenceContext+`
annotation to designate the persistence unit whose factory the container
is using (see Section 8.4.2 "`PersistenceUnit Annotation`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]). You can also
specify the `+type+` element to indicate whether a transaction-scoped
(default) or extended persistence context is to be used (see Section 5.6
"`Container-managed Persistence Contexts`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]).

[source,java]
----
 @PersistenceContext
 EntityManager em;

 @PersistenceContext(type=PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED)
 EntityManager orderEM;
----

The container manages the life cycle of the persistence context, as well
as the creation and closing of the entity manager–your application does
not have to be involved in this process.

For more information, see the following:

* Section 8.4.2 "`PersistenceUnit Annotation`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager in Java SE Environment

You obtain an application-managed entity manager from an entity manager
factory.

For more information and examples, see the following:

* Section 5.2.2 "`Obtaining an Entity Manager in a Java SE Container`"

=== What You May Need to Know About Entity Managers and Their Factories

An entity manager persists and manages specific types of objects,
enables reading from and writing to a given database. You have to
configure the entity manager to do so. You are also responsible for
configuring the entity manager to be implemented by a particular
persistence provider, such as EclipseLink. The provider supplies the
backing implementation engine for the entire Java Persistence API, which
includes an entity manager, a `+Query+` implementation, and SQL
generation.

An entity manager implements the API enabling operations on entities. It
is encapsulated almost entirely within a single interface called
`+EntityManager+`. Until you use an entity manager to create, read, or
write an entity, the entity is nothing more than a regular nonpersistent
Java object.

For more information, see Chapter 5 "`Entity Managers and Persistence
Contexts`" of the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA
Specification].

Applications use the `+EntityManagerFactory+` interface for creating an
application-managed entity manager (see
link:#Obtaining_an_Entity_Manager_in_Java_SE_Environment[Obtaining an
Entity Manager in Java SE Environment]).

Each entity manager factory provides entity manager instances that are
all configured in the same manner (for example, configured to connect to
the same database or use the same initial settings as defined by the
implementation).

=== What You May Need to Know About Persistence Contexts and Persistence Units

When an entity manager (see
link:#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_Entity_Managers_and_Their_Factories[What
You May Need to Know About Entity Managers and Their Factories]) obtains
a reference to an entity (either by having it explicitly passed in or
because it was read from the database) that object becomes managed by
the entity manager. The set of managed entity instances within an entity
manager at any given time is called this entity manager’s persistence
context. Only one Java instance with the same persistent identity may
exist in a persistence context at any time. For example, if an Employee
with a persistent identity (or id) of 158 exists in the persistence
context, then no other object with its id set to 158 may exist within
that same persistence context.

An `+EntityManager+` instance is associated with a persistence context.
A persistence context is a set of entity instances in which for any
persistent entity identity there is a unique entity instance. The entity
instances and their life cycle are managed within the persistence
context. The `+EntityManager+` interface defines the methods for
interacting with the persistence context. The `+EntityManager+` API is
used to create and remove persistent entity instances, to find entities
by their primary key, and to query over entities.

For more information, see Section 5.1 "`Persistence Contexts`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification].

==== Persistence Unit

The set of entities that a given `+EntityManager+` instance manages is
defined by a persistence unit. A persistence unit defines the set of all
classes that are related or grouped by your application, and which must
be collocated in their mapping to a single database.

A persistence unit includes the following:

* An entity manager factory and its entity managers, together with their
configuration information.
* The set of classes managed by the entity managers.
* Mapping metadata (in the form of metadata annotations and/or XML
metadata) that specifies the mapping of the classes to the database.

=== What You May Need to Know About Querying with Java Persistence Query Language

You can use the Java Persistence query language (JP QL) to define
queries over entities and their persistent state.

JP QL is an extension of EJB QL, and adds the following features:

* Single and multiple value result types;
* Aggregate functions with sorting and grouping clauses;
* A more natural jon syntax, including support for both inner and outer
joins;
* Conditional expressions involving subqueries;
* Update and delete queries for bulk data changes;
* Result projection into nonpersistent classes.

JP QL supports the use of dynamic queries and the use of named
parameters. You can use it to define queries over the persistent
entities, as well as their persistent state and relationships

You may define queries in metadata annotations or the XML descriptor.

A JP QL statement may be either a select statement, an update statement,
or a delete statement. All statement types may have parameters. Any
statement may be constructed dynamically or may be statically defined in
a metadata annotation or XML descriptor element.

This example demonstrates how to create a simple query that finds all
orders using JP QL.

[#Example 21-1]## *_Simple Query to Find All Objects_*

[source,sql]
----
 SELECT order
 FROM Order order
----

This example demonstrates how to create a simple query that finds all
orders to ship to California using JP QL.

[#Example 21-2]## *_Simple Query to Find Some Objects_*

[source,sql]
----
 SELECT order
 FROM Order order
 WHERE order.shippingAddress.state = 'CA'
----

For more information and examples, see the following:

* Chapter 4 "`Query Language`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* Section 3.6 "`Query API`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* link:#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_Named_and_Dynamic_Queries[What
You May Need to Know About Named and Dynamic Queries]
* link:#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_Persisting_with_JP_QL[What You
May Need to Know About Persisting with JP QL]

=== What You May Need to Know About Named and Dynamic Queries

You can use the `+Query+` API to define both named and dynamic queries.

Named queries are static and expressed in metadata. You can define named
queries using JP QL or SQL, scoping their names to the persistence unit.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* The query name must be unique within the scope of the
persistence unit.
|===

These queries are efficient to execute as the persistence provider can
translate JP QL to SQL once, when you application starts, as opposed to
every time the query is executed. You define a named query using the
`+@NamedQuery+` annotation (see Section 8.3.1 "`NamedQuery Annotation`"
of the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]), which
you may place on the class definition for any entity. The annotation
defines the name of the query, as well as the query text, as this
example shows:

[#Example 21-3]## *_Defining a Named Query_*

[source,java]
----
 @NamedQuery(name="findSalaryForNameAndDepartment",
             query="SELECT e.salary " +
                   "FROM Employee.e " +
                   "WHERE e.department.name = :deptName AND " +
                   "      e.name = :empName")
----

Place your named query on the entity class that most directly
corresponds to the query result. In the preceding example, that would be
the `+Employee+` entity.

If you need to define more than one named query for a class, place them
inside of a `+@NamedQueries+` annotation (see Section 8.3.1 "`NamedQuery
Annotation`" of the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA
Specification]) that accepts an array of `+@NamedQuery+` annotations, as
this example shows:

[#Example 21-4]## *_Defining Multiple Named Queries for an Entity_*

[source,java]
----
 @NamedQueries({
     @NamedQuery(name="Employee.findAll",
                 query="SELECT e FROM Employee.e"),
     @NamedQuery(name="Employee.findByPrimaryKey",
                 query="SELECT e FROM Employee.e WHERE e.id = :id"),
     @NamedQuery(name="Employee.findByName",
                 query="SELECT e FROM Employee.e WHERE e.name = :name"),
 })
----

Because the query string is defined in the annotation, your application
cannot alter it at run time. If you need to specify additional criteria,
you must do it using query parameters. This example shows how you can
use the `+createNamedQuery+` method of the `+EntityManager+` to create a
named query that requires a query parameter.

[#Example 21-5]##

[source,java]
----
''''' Creating a Named Query with Parameters'''''
 @PersistenceContext
 public EntityManager em;
 ...
 customers = em.createNamedQuery("findAllCustomersWithName")
               .setParameter("custName", "Smith").getResultList();
----

You may choose to define named queries in an XML mapping file (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20(ELUG)#Using_XML[Using
XML]) using the `+named-query+` element. A `+named-query+` element in
the mapping file may also override an existing query of the same name
that was defined as an annotation. A `+named-query+` element may appear
as a subelement of `+entity-mapping+` or `+entity+` elements. Regardless
of where you defined it, it will be keyed by its name in the persistence
unit query namespace. You may provide
link:#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_Query_Hints[query hints] as
`+hint+` subelements.

This example shows the definition a named query in an XML mapping file.
This query uses `+eclipselink.cache-usage+` hint to bypass the cache.

[#Example 21-6]## *_Defining a Named Query in an XML Mapping File_*

[source,xml]
----
 <entity-mapping>
     ...
     <named-query name="findEmployeesWithName">

         <query>SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.name LIKE :empName</query>
         <hint name="eclipselink.cache-usage" value="DoNotCheckCache"/>
     </named-query>
     ...
 <entity-mapping>
----

[cols="<",]
|===
|*Note:* We recommend using named queries with query parameters.
|===

Dynamic queries are strings. You generate these queries at run time by
passing the JP QL query string to the `+createQuery+` method of the
`+EntityManager+`. There are no restrictions on the query definition;
all JP QL query types are supported, as well as the use of parameters.

You may consider using dynamic queries in your application, if there
might be a need to specify complex criteria and the exact shape of the
query cannot be known in advance. However, note that if your application
issues many queries, the use of dynamic queries will have a negative
impact on performance.

=== What You May Need to Know About Persisting with JP QL

You may define queries in metadata annotations or the XML descriptor.

You can use update and delete queries to persist your changes with JP
QL.

You can perform bulk update of entities with the `+UPDATE+` statement.
This statement operates on a single entity type and sets one or more
single-valued properties of the entity subject to the condition in the
`+WHERE+` clause. Update queries provide an equivalent to the
`+SQL UPDATE+` statement, but with JP QL conditional expressions.

This example demonstrates how to use an update query to give employees a
raise. The `+WHERE+` clause contains the conditional expression.

[#Example 21-7]## *_Update Query_*

[source,sql]
----
 UPDATE Employee e
 SET e.salary = 60000
 WHERE e.salary = 50000
----

You can perform bulk removal of entities with the `+DELETE+` statement.
Delete queries provide an equivalent to the `+SQL DELETE+` statement,
but with JP QL conditional expressions.

This example demonstrates how to use a delete query to remove all
employees who are not assigned to a department. The `+WHERE+` clause
contains the conditional expression.

[#Example 21-8]## *_Delete Query_*

[source,sql]
----
 DELETE FROM Employee e
 WHERE e.department IS NULL
----

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* Delete queries are polymorphic: any entity subclass instances
that meet the criteria of the delete query will be deleted. However,
delete queries do not honor cascade rules: no entities other than the
type referenced in the query and its subclasses will be removed, even if
the entity has relationships to other entities with cascade removes
enabled.
|===

The persistence context is not updated to reflect results of update and
delete operations. If you use a transaction-scoped persistence context,
you should either execute the bulk operation in a transaction all by
itself, or be the first operation in the transaction (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Transactions_(ELUG)[Introduction
to EclipseLink Transactions]). That is because any entity actively
managed by the persistence context will remain unaware of the actual
changes occurring at the database level.

For more information and examples, see the following:

* Section 4.10 "`Bulk Update and Delete Operations`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* Chapter 4 "`Query Language`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]

Language]
* link:EclipseLink_UserGuide_Queries_(ELUG)[Queries]
* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Queries%20(ELUG)#Named_Queries[Named
Queries]

=== What You May Need to Know About Persisting Results of Named and Dynamic Queries

Expressions listed in the `+SELECT+` clause of a query determine the
result type of the query. The following are some of the type that may
result from JP QL queries:

* Basic types: `+String+`, primitive types, JDBC types
* Entity types
* An array of `+Object+` instances
* User-defined types created from a constructor-expressions

The collection or single result corresponds directly to the result type
of the query.

The `+Query+` interface provides three different ways to execute a
query, depending on whether or not the query returns results and how
many results are expected. For queries that return values, you can call
either the following methods:

* `+getResultList+`–use this method if you expect the query to return
more than one result. This method returns a collection (`+List+`)
containing query results. If there are no results to return, this method
returns an empty collection.
* `+getSingleResult+`–use this method if you expect the query to return
a single result. In case of unexpected results, such as there are no
results to return or multiple results are available, this method throws
an exception.

Use the `+executeUpdate+` method of the `+Query+` interface to invoke
bulk update and delete queries (see
link:#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_Persisting_with_JP_QL[What You May
Need to Know About Persisting with JP QL]).

The active persistence context manages a returned entity instance. If
that entity instance is modified and the persistence context is part of
a transaction, then the changes will be persisted to the database.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* If you use a transaction-scoped entity manager outside of a
transaction, then the executed query will return detached entity
instances instead of managed entity instances. To make changes to these
detached entities, you must merge them into a persistence context before
synchronizing with the database.
|===

You can reuse `+Query+` objects as often as you need so long as the same
persistence context that you used to create the query is active. For
transaction-scoped entity managers, this limits the lifetime of the
`+Query+` object to the life of the transaction. Other entity manager
types may reuse `+Query+` objects until you close or remove the entity
manager.

==== Using Query Hints

Information pending

==== What You May Need to Know About Query Hints

Query hints are the JPA extension point for vendor-specific query
features. Hints are the only feature in the query API that are not a
standard usage: a hint is a string name and object value.

You may associate your queries with hints by either setting them in the
persistence unit metadata as part of the `+@NamedQuery+` annotation (see
Section 8.3.1 "`NamedQuery Annotation`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]), or by using the
`+setHint+` method of the `+Query+`.

The link:#Example_21-9[Using Query Hints] example shows how to use the
`+eclipselink.cache-usage+` hint to indicate that the cache should not
be checked when reading an `+Employee+` for the database.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* Unlike the `+refresh+` method of the `+EntityManager+`, the
`+eclipselink.cache-usage+` hint will not cause the query result to
override the current cached value.
|===

[#Example 21-9]## *_Using Query Hints_*

[source,java]
----
 public Employee findEmployeeNoCache(int empId) {
     Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.id = ?1");
     // force read from database
     q.setHint("eclipselink.cache-usage", "DoNotCheckCache");
     q.setParameter(1, empId);
     try {
         return (Employee)q.getSingleResult();
     }
     catch(NoResultException e) {
         return null;
     }
 }
----

If you need execute this query frequently, you should use a named query.
The following named query definition incorporates the cache hint from
the link:#Example_21-9[Using Query Hints] example.

`+@NamedQuery(name="findEmployeeNoCache",+`
`+            query="SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.id = :empId",+`
`+            hints={@QueryHint(name="eclipselink.cache-usage", +`
`+                              value="DoNotCheckCache")})+`

The `+hints+` element accepts an array of `+@QueryHint+` annotations
(see Section 8.3 "`Annotations for Queries`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]), allowing you to
set any number of hints for a query.

=== How to Configure Lazy Loading

By default, the EclipseLink persistence provider will use dynamic
weaving to configure all applicable mappings with lazy loading
(indirection).

For JPA entities or POJO classes that you configure for weaving,
EclipseLink weaves value holder indirection for one-to-one mappings. If
you want EclipseLink to weave change tracking and your application
includes collection mappings (one-to-many and many-to-many), then you
must configure all collection mappings to use transparent indirect
container indirection only (you may not configure your collection

=== How to Configure Change Tracking

By default, the EclipseLink persistence provider will use dynamic
weaving to configure all applicable mappings with attribute level change
tracking.

For JPA entities or POJO classes that you configure for weaving,
EclipseLink weaves value holder indirection for one-to-one mappings. If
you want EclipseLink to weave change tracking and your application
includes collection mappings (one-to-many and many-to-many), then you
must configure all collection mappings to use transparent indirect
container indirection only (you may not configure your collection
mappings to use eager loading, nor value holder indirection).

=== How to Configure Fetch Groups

By default, the EclipseLink persistence provider will use dynamic
weaving to configure all applicable mappings to use fetch groups.

=== How to Use Extensions for Caching

Information pending

=== What You May Need to Know About EclipseLink Caching

The EclipseLink cache is an in-memory repository that stores recently
read or written objects based on class and primary key values.
EclipseLink uses the cache to do the following:

* Improve performance by holding recently read or written objects and
accessing them in-memory to minimize database access.
* Manage locking and isolation level.
* Manage object identity.

EclipseLink uses the following two types of cache:

* the session cache maintains objects retrieved from and written to the
data source;
* the unit of work cache holds objects while they participate in
transactions.

When a unit of work successfully commits to the data source, EclipseLink
updates the session cache accordingly.

For more information, see
link:EclipseLink_UserGuide_Caching_with_EclipseLink_(ELUG)[Cache].

=== What You May Need to Know About Cache Coordination

EclipseLink provides a distributed cache coordination feature that
ensures data in distributed applications remains current.

@PrivateOwned Annotation]

=== What You May Need to Know About Cascading Entity Manager Operations

Typically, you use cascading in parent-child relationships.

By default, every entity manager operation applies only to the entity
that you supplied as an argument to the operation. The operation will
not cascade to other entities that have a relationship with the entity
under operation. For some operations, such as `+remove+`, this is
usually the desired behavior. For other operations, such as `+persist+`,
it is not: in most cases, if you have a new entity that has a
relationship to another new entity, you would want to persist both
entities together.

Using the `+cascade+` element of relationship annotations (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20(ELUG)#Mapping_Relationships[Mapping
Relationships]), you can define whether or not to cascade operations
across relationships.

When listed as a part of the `+cascade+` element, you can identify the
entity manager operations with the following constant values using the
`+javax.persitence.CascadeType+` enumerated type:

* `+PERSIST+`–corresponds to the entity manager `+persist+` operation;
* `+REFRESH+`–corresponds to the entity manager `+refresh+` operation;
* `+REMOVE+`–corresponds to the entity manager `+remove+` operation;
* `+MERGE+`–corresponds to the entity manager `+merge+` operation;
* `+ALL+`–indicates that all four operations should be cascaded.

|*Note:* Cascade sessions are unidirectional: you must set them on both
sides of a relationship if you plan for the same behavior for both
situations.

=== What You May Need to Know About Database Platforms

EclipseLink interacts with databases using SQL. The type of database
platform you choose determines the specific means by which the
EclipseLink runtime accesses the database.
