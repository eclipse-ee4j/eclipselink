[#sdo-example-static-overview]
==== Overview

The following example will demonstrate how to use EclipseLink's SDO
functionality to:

* Generate Java source files from an XML Schema using the SDO Compiler
* Define a set of SDO Types from an XML Schema
* Load an XML file and modify its data
* Monitor changes made to the data
* Save the modified data to XML

[#sdo-example-static-setup]
==== Setup

. Ensure that you have EclipseLink correctly installed and configured
for your environment. Please see
link:/EclipseLink/Installing_and_Configuring_EclipseLink[EclipseLink/Installing
and Configuring EclipseLink] for more information.
. Ensure that you have ANT correctly installed and configured.
. Unzip the Example ZIP file to a new directory.
. Edit the `+env.properties+` file in the root directory of the example
and specify the path to your EclipseLink `+jlib+` directory:

[source,properties]
----
...
# Edit eclipselink.jlib to point to your EclipseLink jlib directory
eclipselink.jlib=C:/EclipseLink-1.0/eclipselink/jlib
...
----

You can compile and run the Example at any time by typing `+ant+` from
the Example directory.

For Eclipse IDE users, a `+.project+` file is included in the Example
directory. To setup this project in Eclipse:

. From the "File" menu, choose "Import..."
. In the Import dialog, choose "General > Existing Projects into
Workspace", and click "Next".
. Click "Browse" to select a root directory, and point to the folder
containing this example. After selecting the directory, you should see
the project name in the "Projects" list. Click "Finish".

This project is configured to use a classpath variable,
`+ECLIPSELINK_JLIB+`, to point to the required JAR files. After the
project is imported, you should define a variable called
`+ECLIPSELINK_JLIB+` to point to your EclipseLink `+jlib+` directory.

[#sdo-example-static-run]
==== [#Running_the_SDO_Compiler .mw-headline]#Running the SDO Compiler#

The SDO compiler can be run to generate Static SDO Java files from an
XML Schema:

[source,bash]
----
<ECLIPSELINK_HOME>/eclipselink/bin/sdo-compiler.sh [-options]
<ECLIPSELINK_HOME>\eclipselink\bin\sdo-compiler.cmd [-options]

Options:
   -help                        Prints the help message text
   -sourceFile <filename>       The input schema file (required)
   -targetDirectory <dirname>   The directory to generate Java source (optional)
   -logLevel <level>            Specify the integer value of the logging level
                                (8=OFF,7=SEVERE,6=WARNING,5=INFO,4=CONFIG,3=FINE,2=FINER(default),1=FINEST,0=ALL)
Example:
   sdo-compiler.sh -sourceFile config/Customer.xsd -targetDirectory sdo-compiler-output -logLevel 8
----

For each complex type in the schema, the compiler will generate both an
interface (e.g. `+CustomerType.java+`), and a concrete implementation
which subclasses `+org.eclipse.persistence.sdo.SDODataObject+` (e.g.
`+CustomerTypeImpl.java+`). For this example we will only deal with the
generated interfaces.

In this example, the SDO Compiler is run from the "`+run.sdo.compiler+`"
task in the ANT build file.

[#sdo-example-static-init]
==== Initializing the Types from XML Schema

The first thing that needs to be done in an SDO application is to set up
the metadata for the Types and Properties. This is most commonly done by
loading an XML schema, although it may also be done programmatically.

[source,java]
----
FileInputStream xsdInputStream = new FileInputStream("Customer.xsd");
XSDHelper.INSTANCE.define(xsdInputStream, null);
----

[#sdo-example-static-unmarshall]
==== Unmarshalling the XML Document

With the SDO Types and Properties defined from the schema, we can now
load an XML document based on that schema, and then obtain a
CustomerType object and begin modifying its contents.

....
FileInputStream xmlInputStream = new FileInputStream("Customer-data.xml");
XMLDocument xmlDocument = XMLHelper.INSTANCE.load(xmlInputStream);
CustomerType customer = (CustomerType) xmlDocument.getRootObject();
....

[#sdo-example-static-track]
==== Tracking Object Modifications using Change Summary

SDO's Change Summary provides access to change history information for
the DataObjects in a data graph. A change history covers any
modifications that have been made to a data graph starting from the
point when logging was activated.

In order to use Change Summary, we have defined an element of type
"`+sdo:ChangeSummaryType+`" on our root complex type:

[source,xml]
----
<xs:complexType name="customer-type">
    <xs:sequence>
        ...
        <xs:element name="changeSummary" type="sdo:ChangeSummaryType" minOccurs="0"/>

    </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
----

Before we start modifying our data, we must enable logging:

[source,java]
----
customer.getChangeSummary().beginLogging();
----

From this point on, any modifications to the DataObject will be captured
in the Change Summary, until logging is deactivated:

[source,java]
----
customer.getChangeSummary().endLogging();
----

[#sdo-example-static-modify]
==== Modifying the DataObjects

Below are examples of manipulating the DataObjects using the static
classes. Note that there are JavaBean-type accessors on the static
interfaces.

Modifying the ShippingAddress ZipCode:

[source,java]
----
AddressType address = customer.getContactInfo().getShippingAddress();
address.setZipCode("27601");
----

Adding a new PhoneNumber:

[source,java]
----
PhoneNumber phoneNumber =
  (PhoneNumber) DataFactory.INSTANCE.create("urn:customer-example", "phone-number");
phoneNumber.setNumberType("home");
phoneNumber.setValue("(613) 555-3333");
customer.getContactInfo().getPhoneNumber().add(phoneNumber);
----

Removing all "cell" PhoneNumbers:

[source,java]
----
ArrayList phoneNumbersToRemove = new ArrayList();
List phoneNumbers = customer.getContactInfo().getPhoneNumber();
Iterator it = phoneNumbers.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
   PhoneNumber phoneNumber = (PhoneNumber) it.next();
   if (phoneNumber.getNumberType().equals("cell")) {
      phoneNumbersToRemove.add(phoneNumber);
   }
}
phoneNumbers.removeAll(phoneNumbersToRemove);
----

[#sdo-example-static-marshall]
==== Marshalling the DataObjects

The following code segment demonstrates how to marshal DataObjects
wrapped in a `+commonj.sdo.helper.XMLDocument+` back to XML. In this
example the stream we are saving to is `+System.out+`, so the XML text
will be printed to the console.

[source,java]
----
XMLHelper.INSTANCE.save(xmlDocument, System.out, null);
----

[#sdo-example-static-interpret]
==== Interpreting the Change Summary

When the document is saved to `+System.out+`, we can see the change
summary information in the XML:

[source,xml]
----
<ns1:customer ...>
   ...
   <changeSummary logging="false" xmlns:sdo="commonj.sdo"
      create="#/ns1:contact-info/ns1:phone-number[2]"
      delete="#/changeSummary/ns1:contact-info/ns1:phone-number[2]">
      <ns1:contact-info sdo:ref="#/ns1:contact-info">
         <ns1:phone-number sdo:ref="#/ns1:contact-info/ns1:phone-number[1]"/>
         <ns1:phone-number number-type="cell">(613) 555-2222</ns1:phone-number>
      </ns1:contact-info>
      <shipping-address sdo:ref="#/ns1:contact-info/shipping-address">
         <zip-code>12345</zip-code>
      </shipping-address>
   </changeSummary>
</ns1:customer>
----

* For DataObjects with modified data type properties, the Change Summary
element contains a copy of the DataObject from the data graph, but
containing only the properties which have changed, and showing their old
values.  In our example, we see a "`+shipping-address+`" element which
references "`+#/ns1:contact-info/shipping-address+`" (the element that
was modified), along with its old value, "`+12345+`".

* DataObjects which are currently in the data graph, but were not
present when logging was started are indicated in the change summary
with a "`+create+`" attribute. If more than one DataObject had been
created, the attribute would contain a space-separated list of
references, one for each DataObject. In our example, we see a
"`+create+`" attribute indicating that
"`+#/ns1:contact-info/ns1:phone-number\[2\]+`" (the second phone number
in the XML) is the newly created one.

* DataObjects deleted during logging are flagged with the "`+delete+`"
attribute. In this case the change summary also contains a deep copy of
the object which was deleted, as it no longer appears in the data graph.
Here, we see a "`+delete+`" attribute indicating that
"`+#/changeSummary/ns1:contact-info/ns1:phone-number\[2\]+`" (the second
phone number in the _Change Summary_) is the one that was deleted from
the XML.
