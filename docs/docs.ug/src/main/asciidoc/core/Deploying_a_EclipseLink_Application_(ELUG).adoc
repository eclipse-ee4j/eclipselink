== Deploying Java Applications

Build the JAR file (see
link:Packaging%20a%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Packaging Java
Applications]) and place it on the classpath.

For more information on accessing EclipseLink from your client
application, see
link:Acquiring%20and%20Using%20Sessions%20at%20Run%20Time%20(ELUG)[Acquiring
and Using Sessions at Run Time].

== Deploying JavaServer Pages and Servlets

After you build the WAR and JAR files (see
link:Packaging%20a%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Packaging
JavaServer Pages and Servlet Applications]), build them into an EAR file
for deployment. To deploy the EAR to your JSP servlet server, copy the
EAR to a commonly used directory. You may also need to use
server-specific deployment tools. For more information, see the server
documentation.

For more information on accessing EclipseLink from your client
application, see
link:Acquiring%20and%20Using%20Sessions%20at%20Run%20Time%20(ELUG)[How
to Load a Session from sessions.xml with an Alternative Class Loader].

== Deploying Session Bean Applications

After you build the WAR and JAR files (see
link:Packaging%20a%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Packaging
Session Bean Applications]), build them into an EAR file for deployment.
To deploy the EAR file to your Java EE server, copy the EAR to a
commonly used directory. You may also need to use server-specific
deployment tools. For more information, see the server documentation.

For more information on accessing EclipseLink from your client
application, see
link:Acquiring%20and%20Using%20Sessions%20at%20Run%20Time%20(ELUG)[How
to Load a Session from sessions.xml with an Alternative Class Loader].

Optionally, you may also consider
link:#Performing_Hot_Deployment_of_EJB[Performing Hot Deployment of
EJB].

== Deploying JPA Applications

After you packaged your JPA application, deploy it to an application
server of your choice.

For more information, see
link:Packaging_and_Deploying_EclipseLink_JPA_Applications_(ELUG)[Deploying
an EclipseLink JPA Application].

== Performing Hot Deployment of EJB

Many Java EE containers support _hot deployment_, a feature that enables
you to deploy EJB on a running server. Hot deployment allows you to do
the following:

* Deploy newly developed EJB to a running production system.
* Remove (undeploy) deployed EJB from a running server.
* Modify (redeploy) the behavior of deployed EJB by updating the bean
class definition.

The client receives deployment exceptions when attempting to access
undeployed or re-deployed bean instances. The client application must
catch and handle the exceptions.

How you configure hot deployment of EJB depends on the type of Java EE
application you are deploying:

* POJO application (see
link:#How_to_Perform_Hot_Deployment_in_a_POJO_Application[How to Perform
Hot Deployment in a POJO Application]).

For more information about hot deployment, see the Java EE container
documentation.

=== How to Perform Hot Deployment in a POJO Application

When you take advantage of hot deployment in a POJO application, you
must refresh the EclipseLink session using the `+SessionManager+` method
`+getSession+` with the appropriate arguments (see
link:Acquiring%20and%20Using%20Sessions%20at%20Run%20Time%20(ELUG)[How
to Refresh a Session when the Class Loader Changes].

If you do not use this `+SessionManager+` method, then your application
is responsible for destroying or refreshing the session when a hot
deployment (or hot redeployment) occurs.
