EclipseLink uses
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Working_with_EclipseLink_Metadata[metadata]
to describe how objects relate to a data source representation. Your
mapping and configuration activities construct this metadata.

After creating the metadata, you can use it in any number of
applications by referencing the metadata from
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Sessions%20(ELUG)[a session]. The
EclipseLink runtime uses this metadata in all persistence and data
transformation operations.

== Mapping and Configuration Concepts

This section describes concepts unique to EclipseLink mapping and
configuration, including the following:

* link:#Projects[Projects]
* link:#Descriptors[Descriptors]
* link:#Mappings[Mappings]

=== Projects

The `+Project+` class is the primary container in which EclipseLink
stores its mapping and configuration metadata. A project relates a set
of object classes to a data source at the data model level.

A project contains link:#Descriptors[a descriptor] for each class and
each descriptor contains link:#Mappings[a mapping] for each data member
that EclipseLink should persist or transform.

Using the Workbench, you can export mapping and configuration metadata
into a deployment XML file called `+project+`. For more information, see
link:Creating%20a%20Project%20(ELUG)#Exporting_Project_Information[Exporting
Project Information].

After creating the project XML file, you must associate it with a
session so that EclipseLink can use it at run time. For more
information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Primary_Mapping_Project[Configuring
a Primary Mapping Project].

For Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) applications where there is no session,
deploy the project XML file to the target application server. In this
context, the project XML file is also known as the deployment XML file.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml
File]
* link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#project.xml_File[project.xml
File]
* link:Introduction_to_Projects_(ELUG)[Introduction to Projects].

=== Descriptors

Descriptors describe how a Java class relates to a data source
representation. They relate object classes to the data source at the
data model level. For example, persistent class attributes may map to
database columns.

EclipseLink uses descriptors to store the information that describes how
an instance of a particular class can be represented in a data source
(see link:#Mappings[Mappings]). Most descriptor information can be
defined by the Workbench, then read from the project XML file at run
time.

See link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)[Introduction to
Descriptors] for more information.

=== Mappings

Mappings describe how individual object attributes relate to a data
source representation. Mappings can involve a complex transformation or
a direct entry.

EclipseLink uses mappings to determine how to transform data between
object and data source representation. Most mapping information can be
defined by the Workbench, then read from the project XML file at run
time. Mappings are owned by link:#Descriptors[Descriptors].

See link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Introduction to Mappings]
for more information.
