When you are using server sessions, you can configure the *default read
connection pool* and *write connection pool*. You can also configure the
optional *named connection pools* and *sequence connection pools* you
may have created (see
link:Creating%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_the_Internal_Connection_Pool_Creation[Introduction
to the Internal Connection Pool Creation]).

1Read connection pools only. 2Not applicable to write connection pools.
2Available for sequence connection pools.

== Configuring Connection Pool Sizes

By default, if using EclipseLink internal connection pooling, the
EclipseLink write connection pool maintains a minimum of five
connections and a maximum of ten. The read connection pool maintains a
minimum and maximum of two connections.

Connection pool size can significantly influence the concurrency of your
application and should be set to be large enough to handle your expected
application load.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Tip*: To maintain compatibility with JDBC drivers that do not support
many connections, the default number of connections is small. If your
JDBC driver supports it, use a larger number of connections for reading
and writing.
|===

The smallest value you can enter is 0. Setting the maximum number of
connections to 0 will make it impossible for EclipseLink to allocate any
connections.

The minimum number of connections should always be less than or equal to
the maximum number of connections.

If the maximum number of connections is in use, the next connection
request will be blocked until a connection is available.

=== How to Configure Connection Pool Size Using Workbench

To specify the minimum and maximum number of connections in an
EclipseLink internal connection pool, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Expand a server session to reveal its connection pools in the
*Navigator*.
. Select a connection pool in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear in
the Editor.
. Click the *General* tab. The General tab appears.
[#Figure 97-1]##*_General Tab, Connection Count Options_*
image:cpcount.gif[General Tab, Connection Count
Options,title="General Tab, Connection Count Options"]

Enter the desired minimum and maximum number of connections and press
*Enter* or use the increment and decrement arrows.

For more information, see the following:

* link:#Configuring_Connection_Pool_Sizes[Configuring Connection Pool
Sizes]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Common_Session_Options[Configuring
Common Session Options]

== Configuring Properties

For all connection pools, except write connection pools, you can specify
arbitrary named values, called properties.

Some data sources require additional, driver-specific properties not
supported in the `+ConnectionPool+` API. Add these properties to the
`+ConnectionPool+` so that EclipseLink can pass them to the driver.

=== How to Configure Properties Using Workbench

To specify arbitrary named value pairs that EclipseLink associates with
a `+ConnectionPool+`, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Expand a server session to reveal its connection pools in the
*Navigator*.
. Select a read, named, or sequence connection pool in the *Navigator*.
Its properties appear in the Editor.
. Click the *Login* tab. The Login tab appears.
. Click the *Properties* subtab. The Properties subtab appears.
[#Figure 97-2]##*_Login Tab, Properties Subtab_* image:cpprop.gif[Login
Tab, Properties Subtab,title="Login Tab, Properties Subtab"]
. You can add, edit, or remove properties using Add Property dialog box
that appears upon clicking Add, Edit or Remove.

Complete the *Add Property* dialog box.

Use the following information to add or edit a login property on the Add
Property dialog box to add or edit a login property:

[width="100%",cols="<6%,<94%",options="header",]
|===
|*Option* |*Description*
|*Name* |The name by which EclipseLink retrieves the property value
using the `+DatasourceLogin+` method `+getProperty+`.

|*Value* |The value EclipseLink retrieves using the `+DatasourceLogin+`
method `+getProperty+` passing in the corresponding property name. Using
Workbench, you can set only character values which EclipseLink returns
as `+String+` objects.
|===

To add (or change) a new *Name*/*Value* property, click *Add* (or
*Edit*).

To delete an existing property, select the *Name*/*Value* row and click
*Remove*.

For more information, see link:#Configuring_Properties[Configuring
Properties]

=== How to Configure Properties Using Java

Using Java, you can set any `+Object+` value using the
`+DatasourceLogin+` method `+setProperty+`. To remove a property, use
the `+DatasourceLogin+` method `+removeProperty+`.

== Configuring a Nontransactional Read Login

When you use an external transaction controller (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_the_Server_Platform[Configuring
the Server Platform]), establishing a connection requires not only the
usual connection setup overhead, but also transactional overhead. If
your application reads data only to display it and only infrequently
modifies data, you can configure an internal read connection pool to use
its own connection specification that does not use the external
transaction controller. This may improve performance by reducing the
time it takes to establish a new read connection.

=== How to Configure Nontransactional Read Login Using Workbench

To enable the configuration of nontransactional connection information
for an EclipseLink read connection pool, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Expand a server session to reveal its connection pools in the
*Navigator*.
. Select a read connection pool in the *Navigator*. Its properties
appear in the Editor.
. Click the *Login* tab. The Login tab appears.
. Click the *Connection* subtab. The Connection subtab appears.
[#Figure 97-3]## *_Login Tab, Connection Subtab_*
image:cpnontrn.gif[Login Tab, Connection
Subtab,title="Login Tab, Connection Subtab"]

To enable a nontransactional read login, select the *Use
Non-Transactional Read Login* option (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Data%20Access%20(ELUG)#Externally_Managed_Transactional_Data_Sources[Externally
Managed Transactional Data Sources]). Continue with
link:#Configuring_Connection_Pool_Connection_Options[Configuring
Connection Pool Connection Options] to specify the connection
information.

For more information, see
link:#Configuring_a_Nontransactional_Read_Login[Configuring a
Nontransactional Read Login].

=== How to Configure Nontransactional Read Login Using Java

Use the `+getLogin+` method of your connection pool to obtain a
`+DatabaseLogin+`, and then use the following `+DatabaseLogin+` methods
to configure the nontransactional read login options:

* `+useExternalTransactionController+`
* `+setDriverClass+`
* `+setDriverClassName+`
* `+setDriverURLHeader+`

== Configuring Connection Pool Connection Options

By default, connection pools use the login configuration specified for
their session (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Database_Login_Connection_Options[Configuring
Database Login Connection Options] and
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_EIS_Connection_Specification_Options_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
EIS Connection Specification Options at the Session Level]).

For read, named, and sequence connection pools, you can override the
session login configuration on a per-connection pool basis.

To configure login configuration for a read connection pool, you must
first enable it for link:#Configuring_a_Nontransactional_Read_Login[a
nontransactional read login]).

=== How to Configure Connection Pool Connection Options Using Workbench

To configure connection information for an EclipseLink read, named, or
sequence connection pool, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Expand a server session to reveal its connection pools in the
*Navigator*.
. Select a read, named, or sequence connection pool in the *Navigator*.
Its properties appear in the Editor.
. Click the *Login* tab. The Login tab appears.
. Click the *Connection* subtab. The Connection subtab appears.

. Ensure the *Use Non-Transaction Read Login* option is selected.
. Complete each field on the Connection tab.

Use the following information to complete fields on the Connection
subtab:

Field

Description

Database Driver1

Specify the appropriate database driver:

Driver Manager: Specify this option to configure the driver class and
URL used to connect to the database. In this case, you must configure
the Driver Class and Driver URL fields.

J2EE Datasource: Specify this option to use a Java EE data source
already configured on your target application server. In this case, you
must configure the Datasource Name field.

Note: If you select J2EE Datasource, you must use external connection
pooling. You cannot use internal connection pools with this Database
Driver option (for more information, see Configuring External Connection
Pooling).

Driver Class1

Configure this field when Database Driver is set to Driver Manager.
Select from the menu of options. This menu includes all JDBC drivers in
the EclipseLink application classpath.

URL1

Configure this field when Database Driver is set to Driver Manager.
Select from the menu of options relevant to the selected Driver Class
and edit the URL to suit your data source.

Datasource Name1

Configure this field when Database Driver is set to J2EE Datasource.
Specify any valid JNDI name that identifies the Java EE data source
preconfigured on your target application server (For example:
jdbc/EmployeeDB). By convention, all such names should resolve to the
JDBC subcontext (relative to the standard java:comp/env naming context
that is the root of all provided resource factories).

Connection Specification Class2

Specify the appropriate connection specification class for the selected
Platform. Click Browse to choose from all the classes in the EclipseLink
classpath. (For example: if Platform is
org.eclipse.persistence.eis.aq.AQPlatform, use
org.eclipse.persistence.eis.aq.AQEISConnectionSpec). For more
information on platform configuration, see Configuring an EIS Data
Source Platform at the Session Level.

Connection Factory URL2

Specify the appropriate connection factory URL for the selected
Connection Specification Class (For example:
jdbc:oracle:thin@:localhost:1521:orcl).

1For sessions that contain a `+DatabaseLogin+`. 2For sessions that
contain an `+EISLogin+`.

link:#Configuring_Connection_Pool_Connection_Options[Configuring
Connection Pool Connection Options]

== Configuring Exclusive Read Connections

An exclusive connection is one that EclipseLink allocates specifically
to a given session and one that is never used by any other session.

Allowing concurrent reads on the same connection reduces the number of
read connections required and reduces the risk of having to wait for an
available connection. However, many JDBC drivers do not support
concurrent reads.

If you are using
link:Introduction%20to%20Data%20Access%20(ELUG)#Internal_Connection_Pools[Internal
Connection Pools], you can configure EclipseLink to acquire an exclusive
connection from the read connection pool.

By default, EclipseLink acquires exclusive read connections.

If you are using external connection pools, read connections are always
exclusive.

=== How to Configure Exclusive Read Connections Using Workbench

To configure an EclipseLink read connection pool to allocate exclusive
connections, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Expand a server session to reveal its connection pools in the
*Navigator*.
. Select a read connection pool in the *Navigator*. Its properties
appear in the Editor.
. Click the *Login* tab. The Login tab appears.
. Click the *Connection* subtab. The Connection subtab appears.
[#Figure 97-6]##*_Login Tab, Connection Subtab, Exclusive Connections
Option_* image:exclus.gif[Login Tab, Connection Subtab, Exclusive
Connections
Option,title="Login Tab, Connection Subtab, Exclusive Connections Option"]

Select the *Exclusive Connections* option to configure EclipseLink to
acquire an exclusive connection from the read connection pool.

Deselect the *Exclusive Connections* option to configure EclipseLink to
share read connections and allow concurrent reads. Before selecting this
option, ensure that your JDBC driver supports concurrent reads.
