This section provides an overview of relational projects and focuses on
building these projects for relational and object-relational data type
databases.

For information on project concepts and features common to more than one
type of EclipseLink projects, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)[Introduction to Projects].

== Building Relational Projects

Use a relational project for transactional persistence of Java objects
to a conventional _relational_ database or to an _object-relational data
type_ database that supports data types specialized for object storage,
both accessed using JDBC.

|*Note:* If you are using Workbench, you must add your JDBC driver to
the Workbench classpath. For more information, see
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Configuring_the_Workbench_Environment[Configuring
the Workbench Environment].
|===

In a relational project, you can make full use of EclipseLink queries
and expressions (see
link:EclipseLink_UserGuide_Queries_%28ELUG%29[Queries]).

=== How to Build Relational Projects for a Relational Database

The Workbench provides complete support for creating relational projects
that map Java objects to a conventional relational database accessed
using JDBC.

=== How to Build Relational Projects for an Object-Relational Data Type Database

The Workbench does not currently support relational projects for an
object-relational data type database. You must create such a relational
project in Java.

Using Java, you can create a relational project for transactional
persistence of Java objects to an object-relational data type database
that supports data types specialized for object storage (such as Oracle
Database) accessed using JDBC.

When using EclipseLink to build a relational project for an
object-relational data type database, consider the following:

* You must create a Java class and an EclipseLink
`+ObjectRelationalDescriptor+` for each structured type
(`+Struct/object-type+`).
* EclipseLink supports only arrays (`+Varrays+`) of basic types or
arrays on structured types (`+Struct/object-type+`). EclipseLink does
not support arrays of `+Refs+` or arrays of nested tables.
* EclipseLink supports only nested tables of `+Refs+`. EclipseLink does
not support nested tables of basic types, structured types, or array
types.

The general development process for building a relational project for an
object-relational data type database is as follows:

[arabic]
. Define structured object-types in the database.
. Define tables of the structured object-types in the database.
. Define the Java classes that will map to the structured object-types.
. link:Creating%20a%20Project%20(ELUG)[Create a relational project].
. link:Creating%20an%20Object-Relational%20Data%20Type%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Create
an object-relational data type descriptor for each Java class].
. Create object-relational data type mappings from each persistent field
of each Java class to the corresponding object-types and object-type
tables. For more information, see the following:
* link:Creating%20a%20Mapping%20(ELUG)[Creating a Mapping]

== Sequencing in Relational Projects

In an relational project, you store persistent objects for your
application in database tables that represent the class of instantiated
object. As the link:#Figure_23-1[Sequencing Elements in a Class Database
Table] figure shows, each row of the VEHICLE_POOL table represents an
instantiated object from that class, and the VEH_ID column holds the
primary key for each object.

[#Figure 23-1]## *_Sequencing Elements in a Class Database Table_*

.Sequencing Elements in a Class Database Table
image::seqtable.gif[Sequencing Elements in a Class Database
Table,title="Sequencing Elements in a Class Database Table"]

You configure EclipseLink sequencing at the
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Project%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Project_Level[Project
Level] or
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level[Session
Level] to tell EclipseLink how to obtain values for the primary key
column: that is, whatlink:#Sequencing_Types[type of sequencing to use].

You configure EclipseLink
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Descriptor_Level[configure
Sequencing at the Descriptor Level] to tell EclipseLink into which table
and column to write the sequence value when an instance of a
descriptor’s reference class is created.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* When choosing a column type for a primary key value, ensure
that the type provides a suitable precision. For example, if you use a
`+TIMESTAMP+` type but your database platform’s `+TIMESTAMP+` is defined
only to the second, then identical values may be returned for objects
created within the same second.
|===

This section describes the following:

* link:#Sequencing_Configuration_Options[Sequencing Configuration
Options]
* link:#Sequencing_Types[Sequencing Types]
* link:#Sequencing_and_Preallocation_Size[Sequencing and Preallocation
Size]

=== Sequencing Configuration Options

You can configure sequencing using either the Workbench or Java (but not
both).

Using the Workbench, create one sequence with a single preallocation
size that applies to all descriptors that require sequencing. You can
configure link:#Table_Sequencing[Table Sequencing] or native sequencing
(see link:#Native_Sequencing_with_an_Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with an Oracle Database Platform]). If you choose table
sequencing, you can either use default table and column names or specify
your own (see link:#Default_Versus_Custom_Sequence_Table[Default Versus
Custom Sequence Table]).

Using Java, you can configure any sequence type that EclipseLink
supports (see link:#Sequencing_Types[Sequencing Types]). You can create
any number and combination of sequences per project. You can create a
sequence object explicitly or use the platform
link:#Default_Sequencing[Default Sequencing]. You can associate the same
sequence with more than one descriptor or associate different sequences
(and different sequence types) to various descriptors. You can configure
a separate preallocation size for each descriptor’s sequence. For more
information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#How_to_Configure_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level_Using_Java[How
to Configure Sequencing at the Session Level Using Java].

=== Sequencing Types

EclipseLink supports the following sequence types:

* link:#Table_Sequencing[Table Sequencing]
* link:#Unary_Table_Sequencing[Unary Table Sequencing]
* link:#Query_Sequencing[Query Sequencing]
* link:#Default_Sequencing[Default Sequencing]
* link:#Native_Sequencing_with_an_Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with an Oracle Database Platform]
* link:#Native_Sequencing_with_a_Non-Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with a Non-Oracle Database Platform]

==== Table Sequencing

With table sequencing, you create a single database table that includes
sequencing information for one or more sequenced objects in the project.
EclipseLink maintains this table to track sequence numbers for these
object types.

As the link:#Figure_23-2[EclipseLink Table Sequence Table] figure shows,
the table may contain sequencing information for more than one class
that uses sequencing. The default table is called `+SEQUENCE+` and
contains two columns:

* `+SEQ_NAME+`, which specifies the class type to which the selected row
refers
* `+SEQ_COUNT+`, which specifies the highest sequence number currently
allocated for the object represented in the selected row

[#Figure 23-2]## *_EclipseLink Table Sequence Table_*

.EclipseLink Table Sequence Table
image::seqtblmn.gif[EclipseLink Table Sequence
Table,title="EclipseLink Table Sequence Table"]

The rows of the `+SEQUENCE+` table represent each sequence object: one
for each class that participates in sequencing or a single sequence
object across several classes so that they can benefit from the same
preallocation pool. When you configure
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Descriptor_Level[Sequencing
at the Descriptor Level], you specify the `+SEQ_NAME+` for the class.
Add a row with that name to the `+SEQUENCE+` table and initialize the
`+SEQ_COUNT+` column to the value .

Each time a new instance of a class is created, EclipseLink obtains the
required sequence value. For efficiency, EclipseLink uses preallocation
to reduce the number of table accesses required to obtain sequence
values (see link:#Sequencing_and_Preallocation_Size[Sequencing and
Preallocation Size]).

You can create the `+SEQUENCE+` table on the database in one of two
ways:

* Use the Workbench to create the table. See
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Generating_Tables_on_the_Database[Generating
Tables on the Database] for more information.
* Use the EclipseLink table creator to create and update the table
manually. See
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Generating_SQL_Creation_Scripts[Generating
SQL Creation Scripts] for more information.

You can configure table sequencing using the Workbench or Java. For more
information about configuring table sequencing, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Project%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Project Level] or
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Session Level].

===== Default Versus Custom Sequence Table

In most cases, you implement table sequencing using the default table
and column names. However, you may want to specify your own table and
column names if the following holds true:

* You want to use an existing sequence table for sequencing.
* You do not want to use the default naming convention for the table and
its columns.

==== Unary Table Sequencing

Although similar to link:#Table_Sequencing[Table Sequencing], with unary
table sequencing, you create a separate sequence table for each
sequenced object in the project.

As this figure shows, sequencing information appears in the table for a
single class that uses sequencing. You can name the table anything you
want but it must contain only one column named (by default)
`+SEQUENCE+`.

[#Figure 23-3]## *_EclipseLink Unary Table Sequence Table_*

.EclipseLink Unary Table Sequence Table
image::seqtblun.gif[EclipseLink Unary Table Sequence
Table,title="EclipseLink Unary Table Sequence Table"]

When you configure sequencing at the descriptor level, you specify the
sequence name for the class: this is the name of the unary table
sequence table. The link:#Figure_23-3[EclipseLink Unary Table Sequence
Table] figure shows a unary table sequence for the `+Employee+` class.
The `+Employee+` class descriptor is configured (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Descriptor_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Descriptor Level]) with a sequence name of `+EMP_SEQ+`
to match the unary table sequence table name. EclipseLink adds a row to
this table and initializes the `+SEQUENCE+` column to the value `+1+`.

Each time a new class is created, EclipseLink obtains the required
sequence value from the single row of the unary sequence table
corresponding to the class. For efficiency, EclipseLink uses
preallocation to reduce the number of table accesses required to obtain
sequence values (see link:#Sequencing_and_Preallocation_Size[Sequencing
and Preallocation Size]).

You can create the unary table sequence table on the database in one of
two ways:

* Use the Workbench to create the table. See
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Generating_Tables_on_the_Database[Generating
Tables on the Database] for more information.
* Use the EclipseLink table creator to create and update the table
manually. See
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Generating_SQL_Creation_Scripts[Generating
SQL Creation Scripts] for more information.

Currently, you can only configure unary table sequencing in Java using
the `+UnaryTableSequence+` class (for more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#How_to_Configure_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level_Using_Java[How
to Configure Sequencing at the Session Level Using Java] "`wikilink`")).

==== Query Sequencing

With query sequencing, you can access a sequence resource using custom
read (`+ValueReadQuery+`) and update (`+DataModifyQuery+`) queries and a
preallocation size that you specify. This allows you to perform
sequencing using stored procedures and allows you to access sequence
resources that are not supported by the other sequencing types that
EclipseLink provides.

Currently, you can only configure query sequencing in Java using the
`+QuerySequence+` class (for more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Query_Sequencing[Configuring
Query Sequencing]).

==== Default Sequencing

The platform owned by a login is responsible for providing a default
sequence instance appropriate for the platform type. For example, by
default, a `+DatabasePlatform+` provides a table sequence using the
default table and column names (see link:#Table_Sequencing[Table
Sequencing]).

You can access this default sequence directly using `+DatasourceLogin+`
method `+getDefaultSequence+`, or indirectly by using the
`+DefaultSequence+` class, a wrapper for the platform default sequence.

If you associate a descriptor with a nonexistent sequence, the
EclipseLink runtime will create an instance of `+DefaultSequence+` to
provide sequencing for that descriptor. For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_the_Platform_Default_Sequence[Configuring
the Platform Default Sequence].

The main purpose of the `+DefaultSequence+` is to allow a sequence to
use a different pre-allocation size than the project default.

Currently, you can only make use of default sequencing in Java (for more
information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Using_the_Platform_Default_Sequence[Using
the Platform Default Sequence]).

==== Native Sequencing with an Oracle Database Platform

EclipseLink support for native sequencing with Oracle Databases is
similar to table sequencing (see link:#Table_Sequencing[Table
Sequencing]), except that EclipseLink does not maintain a table in the
database. Instead, the database contains a sequence object that stores
the current maximum number and preallocation size for sequenced objects.
The sequence name configured at the descriptor level identifies the
sequence object responsible for providing sequencing values for the
descriptor’s reference class.

You can configure native sequencing using Workbench or Java. For more
information about configuring table sequencing, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Project%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Project Level] or
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Session Level].

===== Understanding the Oracle SEQUENCE Object

The Oracle `+SEQUENCE+` object implements a strategy that closely
resembles EclipseLink sequencing: it implements an `+INCREMENT+`
construct that parallels the EclipseLink preallocation size, and a
`+sequence.nextval+` construct that parallels the `+SEQ_COUNT+` field in
the EclipseLink `+SEQUENCE+` table in table sequencing. This
implementation enables EclipseLink to use the Oracle `+SEQUENCE+` object
as if it were an EclipseLink `+SEQUENCE+` table, but eliminates the need
for EclipseLink to create and maintain the table.

As with table sequencing, EclipseLink creates a pool of available
numbers by requesting that the Oracle `+SEQUENCE+` object increment the
`+sequence.nextval+` and return the result. Oracle adds the value,
`+INCREMENT+`, to the `+sequence.nextval+`, and EclipseLink uses the
result to build the sequencing pool.

The key difference between this process and the process involved in
table sequencing is that EclipseLink is unaware of the `+INCREMENT+`
construct on the `+SEQUENCE+` object. EclipseLink sequencing and the
Oracle `+SEQUENCE+` object operate in isolation. To avoid sequencing
errors in the application, set the EclipseLink preallocation size and
the Oracle `+SEQUENCE+` object `+INCREMENT+` to the same value. Note
that the Oracle sequence object must have a starting value equal to the
preallocation size because when EclipseLink gets the next sequence
value, it assume it has the previous preallocation size of values.

===== Using SEQUENCE Objects

Your database administrator (DBA) must create a `+SEQUENCE+` object on
the database for every sequencing series your application requires. If
every class in your application requires its own sequence, the DBA
creates a `+SEQUENCE+` object for every class; if you design several
classes to share a sequence, the DBA need create only one `+SEQUENCE+`
object for those classes.

For example, in the link:#Figure_23-4[Example of Database Tables–Racquet
Information] figure, consider the case of a sporting goods manufacturer
that manufactures three styles of tennis racquet. The data for these
styles of racquet are stored in the database as follows:

* Each style of racquet has its own class table.
* Each manufactured racquet is an object represented by a line in the
class table.
* The system assigns serial numbers to the racquets that use sequencing.

[#Figure 23-4]## *_Example of Database Tables–Racquet Information_*

.Example of Database Tables–Racquet Information
image::orseqa.gif[Example of Database Tables–Racquet
Information,title="Example of Database Tables–Racquet Information"]

The manufacturer can do either of the following:

* _Use separate sequencing for each racquet style._ The DBA builds three
separate `+SEQUENCE+` objects, perhaps called `+ATTACK_SEQ+`,
`+VOLLEY_SEQ+`, and `+PROX_SEQ+`. Each different racquet line has its
own serial number series, and there may be duplication of serial numbers
between the lines (for example: all three styles may include a racquet
with serial number 1234).
* _Use a single sequencing series for all racquets._ The DBA builds a
single `+SEQUENCE+` object (perhaps called `+RACQUET_SEQ+`). The
manufacturer assigns serial numbers to racquets as they are produced,
without regard for the style of racquet.

==== Native Sequencing with a Non-Oracle Database Platform

Several databases support a type of native sequencing in which the
database management system generates the sequence numbers.

When you create a database table for a class that uses native
sequencing, include a primary key column, and set the column type as
follows:

* For Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server databases, set the primary key
field to the type `+IDENTITY+`.
* For IBM Informix databases, set the primary key field to the type
`+SERIAL+`.
* For IBM DB2 databases, set the primary key field to the type
`+IDENTITY+`.

When you insert a new object into the table, EclipseLink populates the
object before insertion into the table, but does not include the
sequence number. As the database inserts the object into its table, the
database automatically populates the primary key field with a value
equal to the primary key of the previous object plus `+1+`.

At this point, and before the transaction closes, EclipseLink reads back
the primary key for the new object so that the object has an identity in
the EclipseLink cache.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* This type of sequencing does not support preallocation, so the
preallocation size must be set to 1. To take advantage of sequence
preallocation, we recommend that you use table sequencing on these
databases instead of native sequencing.
|===

If your database provides native sequencing, but EclipseLink does not
directly support it, you may be able to access the native sequence
object using a query sequence and stored procedures. For more
information, see link:#Query_Sequencing[Query Sequencing].

You can configure native sequencing using Workbench or Java. We
recommend that you use the Workbench. For more information about
configuring table sequencing, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Project%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Project Level] or
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Session Level].

=== Sequencing and Preallocation Size

To improve sequencing efficiency, EclipseLink lets you preallocate
sequence numbers. Preallocation enables EclipseLink to build a pool of
available sequence numbers that are assigned to new objects as they are
created and inserted into the database. EclipseLink assigns numbers from
the sequence pool until the pool is empty.

The preallocation size specifies the size of the pool of available
numbers. Preallocation improves sequencing efficiency by substantially
reducing the number of database accesses required by sequencing. By
default, EclipseLink sets preallocation size to `+50+`. You can specify
preallocation size either in the Workbench or as part of the session
login.

Preallocation size configuration applies to table sequencing and Oracle
native sequencing. In Oracle native sequencing, the sequence
preallocation size must match the Oracle sequence object increment size.
Preallocation is not available for native sequencing in other databases
as they use an auto-assigned sequence column. We recommend that you use
table sequencing in non-Oracle databases to allow preallocation.

For table sequencing, EclipseLink maintains a pool of preallocated
values for each sequenced class. When EclipseLink exhausts this pool of
values, it acquires a new pool of values, as follows:

[arabic]
. EclipseLink accesses the database, requesting that the `+SEQ_COUNT+`
for the given class (identified by the `+SEQ_NAME+`) be incremented by
the preallocation size and the result returned. For example, consider
the `+SEQUENCE+` table in the link:#Figure_23-2[EclipseLink Table
Sequence Table] figure. If you create a new purchase order and
EclipseLink has exhausted its pool of sequence numbers, then EclipseLink
executes a SQL statement to increment `+SEQ_COUNT+` for
`+SEQ_PURCH_ORDER+` by the preallocation size (in this case, the
EclipseLink default of `+50+`). The database increments `+SEQ_COUNT+`
for `+SEQ_PURCH_ORDER+` to `+1600+` and returns this number to
EclipseLink.
. EclipseLink calculates a maximum and a minimum value for the new
sequence number pool, and creates the pool of values.
. EclipseLink populates the object sequence attribute with the first
number in the pool and writes the object to the class table.

As you add new objects to the class table, EclipseLink continues to
assign values from the pool until it exhausts the pool. When the pool is
exhausted, EclipseLink again requests new values from the table.

Using the Workbench, you specify a preallocation size when you choose a
sequencing type at the project or session level. That preallocation size
applies to all descriptors.

Using Java, you can specify a different preallocation size for each
sequence that you create.

For more information about configuring preallocation size, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Project%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Project Level] or
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
Sequencing at the Session Level].
