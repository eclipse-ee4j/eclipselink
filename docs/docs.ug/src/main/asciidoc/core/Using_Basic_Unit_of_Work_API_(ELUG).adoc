*TOC* Special:Whatlinkshere_Using_Basic_Unit_of_Work_API_(ELUG)[Related
Topics]

This section explains the essential unit of work API calls that you are
most likely to use throughout the development cycle. For more
information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Advanced
Unit of Work API].

== Acquiring a Unit of Work

This example shows how to acquire a unit of work from a client session
object.

`+Server server = (Server) SessionManager.getManager().getSession(+`
`+                sessionName, MyServerSession.class.getClassLoader());+`
`+Session session = (Session) server.acquireClientSession();+`
`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`

You can acquire a unit of work from any session type. For more
information about acquiring sessions at run time, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Sessions%20(ELUG)[Acquiring a
Session at Run Time with the Session Manager].

Note that you do not need to create a new session and log in before
every transaction. The recommended pattern is to acquire a client
session per client access (or thread), and then acquire the necessary
unit of work from this client session.

The unit of work is valid until the `+commit+` or `+release+` method is
called. After a commit or release transaction, a unit of work is not
valid even if the transaction fails and is rolled back.

A unit of work remains valid after the `+commitAndResume+` method is
called, as described in
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)[Resuming a Unit
of Work After Commit].

When using a unit of work with JTA, you should also use the advanced API
`+getActiveUnitOfWork+` method, as described in
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)[Integrating the
Unit of Work with an External Transaction Service].

== Creating an Object

When you create new objects in the unit of work, use the
`+registerObject+` method to ensure that the unit of work writes the
objects to the database at commit time.

The unit of work calculates commit order using foreign key information
from one-to-one and one-to-many mappings. If you encounter constraint
problems during a commit transaction, verify your mapping definitions.
The order in which you register objects with the `+registerObject+`
method does not affect the commit order.

link:#Example_110-1[Creating an Object: Preferred Method] and
link:#Example_110-2[Creating an Object: Alternative Method] examples
show how to create and persist a simple object (without relationships)
using the clone returned by the unit of work `+registerObject+` method.

[#Example 110-1]## *_Creating an Object: Preferred Method_*

`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet pet = new Pet();+`
`+Pet petClone = (Pet)uow.registerObject(pet);+`
`+petClone.setId(100);+` `+petClone.setName("Fluffy");+`
`+petClone.setType("Cat");+` `+uow.commit();+`

This example shows a common alternative.

[#Example 110-2]## *_Creating an Object: Alternative Method_*

`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet pet = new Pet();+` `+pet.setId(100);+` `+pet.setName("Fluffy");+`
`+pet.setType("Cat");+` `+uow.registerObject(pet); +` `+uow.commit();+`

Both approaches produce the following SQL:

`+INSERT INTO PET (ID, NAME, TYPE, PET_OWN_ID) VALUES (100, 'Fluffy', 'Cat', NULL)+`

You should follow the link:#Example_110-1[Creating an Object: Preferred
Method] example: it gets you into the pattern of working with clones and
provides the most flexibility for future code changes. Working with
combinations of new objects and clones can lead to confusion and
unwanted results.

== Modifying an Object

In the link:#Example_110-3[Modifying an Object] example, a `+Pet+` is
read prior to a unit of work: the variable `+pet+` is the cache copy
clone for that `+Pet+`. Inside the unit of work, register the cache copy
to get a working copy clone, then modify the working copy clone and
commit the unit of work.

[#Example 110-3]## *_Modifying an Object_*

*`+//\'\' \'\'Read\'\' \'\'in\'\' \'\'any\'\' \'\'pet+`*
`+Pet pet = (Pet)session.readObject(Pet.class);+`
`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet petClone = (Pet) uow.registerObject(pet);+`
`+petClone.setName("Furry");+` `+uow.commit();+`

link:#Example_110-4[Modifying an Object: Skipping the Registration Step]
example shows how to take advantage of the fact that you can query
through a unit of work and get back clones, saving the registration
step. However, the drawback is that you do not have a handle to the
cache copy clone.

If you wanted to do something with the updated `+Pet+` after the commit
transaction, you would have to query the session to get it (remember
that after a unit of work is committed, its clones are invalid and
should not be used).

[#Example 110-4]## *_Modifying an Object: Skipping the Registration
Step_*

`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet petClone = (Pet) uow.readObject(Pet.class);+`
`+petClone.setName("Furry");+` `+uow.commit();+`

Both approaches produce the following SQL:

`+UPDATE PET SET NAME = 'Furry' WHERE (ID = 100)+`

Take care when querying through a unit of work. All objects read in the
query are registered in the unit of work and therefore will be checked
for changes at commit time. Rather than do a `+ReadAllQuery+` through a
unit of work, it is better for performance to design your application to
do the `+ReadAllQuery+` through a session, and then register in a unit
of work only the objects that need to be changed.

== Associating a New Target to an Existing Source Object

Required]

Deciding which approach to use depends on whether or not your code
requires a reference to the cache copy clone of the new object after the
unit of work is committed, and on how adaptable to change you want your
code to be.

=== How to Associate a New Target to an Existing Source Object in a Unidirectional Relationship: Reference to the New Cache Object After Commit not Required

link:#Example_110-5[Associating Without Reference to the Cache Object]
example shows how to associate a new target with an existing source in a
unidirectional relationship without retaining a reference to the cache
object.

When the `+Pet+` object is read using the unit of work, EclipseLink
automatically registers it. Because there is a unidirectional
relationship between the `+Pet+` object and the new `+PetOwner+` and
`+VetVisit+` objects, you do not need to register the new `+PetOwner+`
or `+VetVisit+` objects. EclipseLink can reach these new objects through
the registered `+Pet+` object and automatically detect that they are new
objects.

[#Example 110-5]## *_Associating Without Reference to the Cache Object_*

`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet petClone = (Pet)uow.readObject(Pet.class);+`

`+PetOwner petOwner = new PetOwner();+` `+petOwner.setId(400);+`
`+petOwner.setName("Donald Smith");+`
`+petOwner.setPhoneNumber("555-1212");+`

`+VetVisit vetVisit = new VetVisit();+` `+vetVisit.setId(500);+`
`+vetVisit.setNotes("Pet was shedding a lot.");+`
`+vetVisit.setSymptoms("Pet in good health.");+`
`+vetVisit.setPet(petClone);+`

`+petClone.setPetOwner(petOwner);+`
`+petClone.getVetVisits().add(vetVisit); +` `+uow.commit();+`

This executes the following proper SQL:

`+INSERT INTO PETOWNER (ID, NAME, PHN_NBR) VALUES (400, 'Donald Smith', '555-1212')+`
`+UPDATE PET SET PET_OWN_ID = 400 WHERE (ID = 100)+`
`+INSERT INTO VETVISIT (ID, NOTES, SYMPTOMS, PET_ID) VALUES (500, 'Pet was shedding a lot.', 'Pet in good health.', 100)+`

When associating new objects to existing objects, the unit of work
treats the new object as if it were a clone. That is, after the commit
transaction:

`+petOwner != session.readObject(petOwner)+`

Therefore, after the unit of work commit transaction, the variables
`+vetVisit+` and `+petOwner+` no longer point to their respective cache
objects; they point at working copy clones.

If you need the cache object after the unit of work commit transaction,
you must query for it or create the association with a reference to the
cache object (as described in
#How_to_Associate_a_New_Target_to_an_Existing_Source_Object_in_a_Unidirectional_Relationship:_Reference_to_the_New_Cache_Object_After_Commit_Required[How
to Associate a New Target to an Existing Source Object in a
Unidirectional Relationship: Reference to the New Cache Object After
Commit Required]).

If there was a bidirectional relationship between the source and target
objects, you must take more care when registering them (see
#How_to_Associate_a_New_Target_to_an_Existing_Source_Object_in_a_Bidirectional_Relationship:_Query_for_Target_Before_Commit_not_Required[How
to Associate a New Target to an Existing Source Object in a
Bidirectional Relationship: Query for Target Before Commit not
Required]).

=== How to Associate a New Target to an Existing Source Object in a Unidirectional Relationship: Reference to the New Cache Object After Commit Required

link:#Example_110-6[Associating With Reference to the Cache Object]
example shows how to associate a new target with an existing source in a
unidirectional relationship and retain a reference to the cache object.

When the `+Pet+` object is read using the unit of work, EclipseLink
automatically registers it. Because there is a unidirectional
relationship between the `+Pet+` object and the new `+PetOwner+` and
`+VetVisit+` objects, you do not need to register the new `+PetOwner+`
or `+VetVisit+` objects. EclipseLink can reach these new objects through
the registered `+Pet+` object and automatically detect that they are new
objects.

However, by using `+UnitOfWork+` method `+registerObject+`, you can
retain a handle to the post-commit cache objects in case your code needs
to continue using them after commit: for example, to display their new
contents in a GUI.

If there was a bidirectional relationship between the source and target
objects, you must take more care when registering them (see
#How_to_Associate_a_New_Target_to_an_Existing_Source_Object_in_a_Bidirectional_Relationship:_Query_for_Target_Object_Before_Commit_Required[How
to Associate a New Target to an Existing Source Object in a
Bidirectional Relationship: Query for Target Object Before Commit
Required]).

[#Example 110-6]## *_Associating With Reference to the Cache Object_*

`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet petClone = (Pet)uow.readObject(Pet.class);+`

`+PetOwner petOwner = new PetOwner();+`
`+PetOwner petOwnerClone = (PetOwner)uow.registerObject(petOwner);+`
`+petOwnerClone.setId(400);+` `+petOwnerClone.setName("Donald Smith");+`
`+petOwnerClone.setPhoneNumber("555-1212");+`

`+VetVisit vetVisit = new VetVisit();+`
`+VetVisit vetVisitClone = (VetVisit)uow.registerObject(vetVisit);+`
`+vetVisitClone.setId(500);+`
`+vetVisitClone.setNotes("Pet was shedding a lot.");+`
`+vetVisitClone.setSymptoms("Pet in good health.");+`
`+vetVisitClone.setPet(petClone);+`

`+petClone.setPetOwner(petOwnerClone);+`
`+petClone.getVetVisits().addElement(vetVisitClone); +`
`+uow.commit();+`

Now, after the unit of work commit transaction:

`+petOwner == session.readObject(petOwner)+`

This means that we have a handle to the cache copy after the commit
transaction, rather than a clone.

=== How to Associate a New Target to an Existing Source Object in a Bidirectional Relationship: Query for Target Before Commit not Required

Consider an `+Employee+` class implemented, as
link:#Example_110-7[Employee Class] example shows. Note that the
`+setManager+` method modifies the `+Employee+` instance you pass into
it.

[#Example 110-7]## *_Employee Class_*

`+public class Employee {+`

`+    private Collection managedEmployees = new ArrayList();+`
`+    private Emplyoee myManager;+`

`+    ...+`

`+    public setManager(Employee manager) {+`
`+        myManager = manager;+`
`+        manager.addManagedEmployee(this);+` `+    }+`

`+    public addManagedEmployee(Employee employee) {+`
`+        managedEmployees.add(employee);+` `+    }+`

`+    ...+`

`+}+`

link:#Example_110-8[Resolving Issues When Adding New Objects] example
shows how to register a new object when a bidirectional relationship
exists such as that between manager and employee.

Because `+Employee+` method `+setManager+` modifies the `+Employee+` you
pass in (as link:#Example_110-7[Employee Class] example shows), you must
pass in `+managerClone+` that `+registerObject+` returns.

After you call `+setManager+`, you establish the bidirectional
relationship between `+newEmployee+` and `+managerClone+`. Because
`+newEmployee+` is reachable from the `+manager+` object already
registered with the unit of work, EclipseLink can automatically detect
that it is a new object. Consequently, you do not need to register
`+newEmployee+` at all and it is, in fact, an error to call
`+registerObject+` on `+newEmployee+` in this case.

If your code must be able to query for the new child object prior to
commit, see
#How_to_Associate_a_New_Target_to_an_Existing_Source_Object_in_a_Bidirectional_Relationship:_Query_for_Target_Object_Before_Commit_Required[How
to Associate a New Target to an Existing Source Object in a
Bidirectional Relationship: Query for Target Object Before Commit
Required].

If you need the cache object after the unit of work commit transaction,
in this case, you must query for it.

*`+//\'\' \'\'Commit\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'unit\'\' \'\'of\'\' \'\'work+`*
`+uow.commit();+`

Because `+Employee+` method `+setManager+` modifies the `+Employee+` you
pass in (as link:#Example_110-10[Resolving Issues When Adding New
Objects] example), you must pass in `+managerClone+` that
`+registerObject+` returns.

After you call `+setManager+`, you establish the bidirectional
relationship between `+newEmployee+` and `+managerClone+`. Because
`+newEmployee+` is reachable from the `+manager+` object already
registered with the unit of work, EclipseLink can automatically detect
that it is a new object. Consequently, you do not need to register
`+newEmployee+` at all and it is, in fact, an error to call
`+registerObject+` on `+newEmployee+` in this case.

If your code must be able to query for the new child object prior to
commit, register the new object using `+UnitOfWork+` method
`+registerNewObject+`. Unlike `+registerObject+`, this method does not
create a clone.

Another difference between `+registerNewObject+` and `+registerObject+`
is that `+registerNewObject+` does not cascade registration to child
objects. If you call `+registerNewObject+` on a parent object, you must
also call `+registerNewObject+` on new child instances if your code must
be able to query for the new child object prior to commit and you prefer
not to use conforming queries.

If you need the cache object after the unit of work commit transaction,
you must query for it.

== Associating a New Source to an Existing Target Object

This section describes how to associate a new source object with an
existing target object with one-to-many and one-to-one relationships.

EclipseLink follows all relationships of all registered objects (deeply)
in a unit of work to calculate what is new and what has changed. This is
known as _persistence by reachablity_. In
link:#Associating_a_New_Target_to_an_Existing_Source_Object[Associating
a New Target to an Existing Source Object] example, you saw that when
you associate a new target with an existing source, you can choose to
register the object or not. If you do not register the new object, it is
still reachable from the source object (which is a clone, hence it is
registered). However, when you need to associate a new source object
with an existing target, you must register the new object. If you do not
register the new object, then it is not reachable in the unit of work,
and EclipseLink will not write it to the database.

link:#Example_110-11[Associating a New Source to an Existing Target
Object] example shows how to create a new `+Pet+` and associate it with
an existing `+PetOwner+`.

[#Example 110-11]## *_Associating a New Source to an Existing Target
Object_*

`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+PetOwner existingPetOwnerClone =+`
`+        (PetOwner)uow.readObject(PetOwner.class);+`

`+Pet newPet = new Pet();+`
`+Pet newPetClone = (Pet)uow.registerObject(newPet);+`
`+newPetClone.setId(900);+` `+newPetClone.setType("Lizzard");+`
`+newPetClone.setName("Larry");+`
`+newPetClone.setPetOwner(existingPetOwnerClone);+` `+uow.commit();+`

This generates the following proper SQL:

`+INSERT INTO PET (ID, NAME, TYPE, PET_OWN_ID) VALUES (900, 'Larry', 'Lizzard', 400)+`

In this situation, you should register the new object and work with the
working copy of the new object. If you associate the new object with the
`+PetOwner+` clone without registering, it will not be written to the
database.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* You cannot use `+UnitOfWork+` methods `+registerObject+`,
`+registerNewObject+`, or `+registerExistingObject+` with an aggregate
object (see
link:Creating%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Creating Relational
Aggregate Descriptors]). Doing so will raise a ValidationException or
other errors at commit time. For more information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)[How to Work with
Aggregates].
|===

If you fail to register the clone and accidentally associate the cache
version of the existing object with the new object, then EclipseLink
will generate an error which states that you have associated the cache
version of an object ("`from a parent session`") with a clone from this
unit of work. You must work with working copies in units of work.

== Associating an Existing Source to an Existing Target Object

This section explains how to associate an existing source object with an
existing target object with one-to-many and one-to-one relationships.

As shown in link:#Example_110-12[Associating an Existing Source to
Existing Target Object] example, associating existing objects with each
other in a unit of work is as simple as associating objects in Java.
Just remember to only work with working copies of the objects.

[#Example 110-12]## *_Associating an Existing Source to Existing Target
Object_*

*`+//\'\' \'\'Associate\'\' \'\'all\'\' \'\'VetVisits\'\' \'\'in\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'database\'\' \'\'to\'\' \'\'a\'\' \'\'Pet\'\' \'\'from\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'database+`*
`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet existingPetClone = (Pet)uow.readObject(Pet.class);+`
`+List allVetVisitClones;+`
`+allVetVisitClones = uow.readAllObjects(VetVisit.class);+`
`+Iterator iter = allVetVisitClones.elements();+`
`+while(iter.hasNext()) {+`
`+    VetVisit vetVisitClone =(VetVisit)iter.next();+`
`+    existingPetClone.getVetVisits().add(vetVisitClone);+`
`+    vetVisitClone.setPet(existingPetClone);+` `+};+` `+uow.commit();+`

The most common error when associating existing objects is failing to
work with the working copies. If you accidentally associate a cache
version of an object with a working copy you will get an error at commit
time indicating that you associated an object from a parent session (the
cache version) with a clone from this unit of work.

link:#Example_110-13[Associating Existing Objects] example shows another
example of associating an existing source to an existing target object.

== Deleting Objects

To delete objects in a unit of work, use the `+deleteObject+` or
`+deleteAllObjects+` method. When you delete an object that is not
already registered in the unit of work, the unit of work registers the
object automatically.

When you delete an object, EclipseLink deletes the object’s privately
owned child parts, because those parts cannot exist without the owning
(parent) object. At commit time, the unit of work generates SQL to
delete the objects, taking database constraints into account.

When you delete an object, you must take your object model into account.
You may need to set references to the deleted object to null (for an
example, see link:#How_to_Use_the_privateOwnedRelationship_Attribute[How
to Use the privateOwnedRelationship Attribute]).

This section explains how to delete objects within a unit of work,
including the following:

* link:#How_to_Use_the_privateOwnedRelationship_Attribute[How to Use the
privateOwnedRelationship Attribute]
* link:#How_to_Explicitly_Delete_from_the_Database[How to Explicitly
Delete from the Database]
* link:#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_the_Order_in_which_Objects_Are_Deleted[What
You May Need to Know About the Order in which Objects Are Deleted]

=== How to Use the privateOwnedRelationship Attribute

Relational databases do not have garbage collection like a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) does. To delete an object in Java you just remove the
reference to the object. To delete a row in a relational database, you
must explicitly delete it. Rather than tediously manage when to delete
data in the relational database, use the mapping attribute
`+privateOwnedRelationship+` to have EclipseLink manage the garbage
collection in the relational database for you.

As shown in the link:#Example_110-14[Specifying a Mapping as Privately
Owned] example, when you create a mapping using Java, use its
`+privateOwnedRelationship+` method to tell EclipseLink that the
referenced object is privately owned: that is, the referenced child
object cannot exist without the parent object.

[#Example 110-14]## *_Specifying a Mapping as Privately Owned_*

`+OneToOneMapping petOwnerMapping = new OneToOneMapping();+`
`+petOwnerMapping.setAttributeName("petOwner");+`
`+petOwnerMapping.setReferenceClass(com.top.uowprimer.model.PetOwner.class);+`
`+petOwnerMapping.privateOwnedRelationship();+`
`+petOwnerMapping.addForeignKeyFieldName("PET.PET_OWN_ID", "PETOWNER.ID");+`
`+descriptor.addMapping(petOwnerMapping);+`

When you create a mapping using Workbench, you can select the *Private
Owned* check box under the *General* tab.

When you tell EclipseLink that a relationship is privately owned, you
are specifying the following:

* If the source of a privately owned relationship is deleted, then
delete the target.
* If you remove the reference to a target from a source, then delete the
target.

Do not configure privately owned relationships to objects that might be
shared. An object should not be the target in more than one relationship
if it is the target in a privately owned relationship.

The exception to this rule is the case when you have a many-to-many
relationship in which a relation object is mapped to a relation table
and is referenced through a one-to-many relationship by both the source
and the target. In this case, if the one-to-many mapping is configured
as privately owned, then when you delete the source, all the association
objects will be deleted.

Consider the link:#Example_110-15[Privately Owned Relationships]
example.

[#Example 110-15]## *_Privately Owned Relationships_*

*`+//\'\' \'\'If\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'Pet-PetOwner\'\' \'\'relationship\'\' \'\'is\'\' \'\'privateOwned+`*
*`+//\'\' \'\'then\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'PetOwner\'\' \'\'will\'\' \'\'be\'\' \'\'deleted\'\' \'\'at\'\' \'\'uow.commit()+`*
*`+//\'\' \'\'otherwise,\'\' \'\'just\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'foreign\'\' \'\'key\'\' \'\'from\'\' \'\'PET\'\' \'\'to\'\' \'\'PETOWNER\'\' \'\'will+`*
*`+//\'\' \'\'be\'\' \'\'set\'\' \'\'to\'\' \'\'null.\'\' \'\'The\'\' \'\'same\'\' \'\'is\'\' \'\'true\'\' \'\'for\'\' \'\'VetVisit+`*
`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+Pet petClone = (Pet)uow.readObject(Pet.class);+`
`+petClone.setPetOwner(null);+`
`+VetVisit vvClone = (VetVisit)petClone.getVetVisits().get(0);+`
`+vvClone.setPet(null);+` `+petClone.getVetVisits().remove(vvClone);+`
`+uow.commit();+`

If the relationships from `+Pet+` to `+PetOwner+` and from `+Pet+` to
`+VetVisit+` are not privately owned, this code produces the following
SQL:

`+UPDATE PET SET PET_OWN_ID = NULL WHERE (ID = 150)+`
`+UPDATE VETVISIT SET PET_ID = NULL WHERE (ID = 350)+`

If the relationships are privately owned, this code produces the
following SQL:

`+UPDATE PET SET PET_OWN_ID = NULL WHERE (ID = 150)+`
`+UPDATE VETVISIT SET PET_ID = NULL WHERE (ID = 350)+`
`+DELETE FROM VETVISIT WHERE (ID = 350)+`
`+DELETE FROM PETOWNER WHERE (ID = 250)+`

=== How to Explicitly Delete from the Database

If there are cases where you have objects that will not be garbage
collected through privately owned relationships (especially root objects
in your object model), then you can explicitly tell EclipseLink to
delete the row representing the object using the `+deleteObject+` API,
as shown in the link:#Example_110-16[Explicitly Deleting] example.

[#Example 110-16]## *_Explicitly Deleting_*

`+UnitOfWork uow = session.acquireUnitOfWork();+`
`+pet petClone = (Pet)uow.readObject(Pet.class);+`
`+uow.deleteObject(petClone);+` `+uow.commit();+`

The preceding code generates the following SQL:

`+DELETE FROM PET WHERE (ID = 100)+`

=== What You May Need to Know About the Order in which Objects Are Deleted

The unit of work does not track changes or the order of operations. It
is intended to insulate you from having to modify your objects in the
order the database requires.

By default, at commit time, the unit of work correctly puts in order all
insert and update operations using the constraints defined by your
schema. After all insert and update operations are done, the unit of
work will issue the necessary delete operations.

Constraints are inferred from one-to-one and one-to-many mappings. If
you have no such mappings, you can add additional constraint knowledge
to EclipseLink as described in
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)[Controlling the
Order of Delete Operations].
