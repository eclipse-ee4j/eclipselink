== Configuring Foreign Key Pairs

In a one-to-many EIS mapping, you relate a source object attribute to a
target object attribute by specifying one or more pairs of source and
target object fields.

In a one-to-many EIS mapping with key on source (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#EIS_One-to-Many_Mappings_with_Key_on_Source[EIS
One-to-Many Mappings with Key on Source]) using XML records, EclipseLink
puts the target XML field value into the source object’s record as a
simple value. By default, these values are not grouped, as this example
shows.

[#Example 80-1]## *_Source Object XML Record without Grouping_*

`+    +``+Jane+` `+    +``+3+` `+    +``+4+`

If you specify more than one source and target XML field pair, you must
specify a grouping element, as this example shows.

[#Example 80-2]## *_Source Object XML Record with Grouping_*

`+    +``+Jane+`

`+    +` `+        +``+3+` `+        +``+Project 3+` `+    +` `+    +`

`+        +``+4+` `+        +``+Project 4+` `+    +`

In a one-to-one EIS mapping with key on target (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#EIS_One-to-Many_Mappings_with_Key_on_Target[EIS
One-to-Many Mappings with Key on Target]) using XML records, EclipseLink
uses the source XML field value in the selection interaction to acquire
the appropriate instances of target object.

=== How to Configure Foreign Key Pairs Using Workbench

To specify the source and target XML field pairs for a one-to-many EIS
mapping, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the one-to-one EIS mapping in the *Navigator*. Its properties
appear in the Editor.
. Click the *General* tab. The General tab appears.
[#Figure 80-1]##*_Foreign Keys Field on General Tab_*

Tab,title="Foreign Keys Field on General Tab"]
. Complete the Foreign Keys fields on the General tab.

Use the following information to complete the Foreign Keys fields on the
*General* tab:

Field

Description

Foreign Keys Located On Target

Select if you are creating a one-to-many EIS mapping with key on target
(see EIS One-to-Many Mappings with Key on Target).

Foreign Keys Located On Source

Select if you are creating a one-to-many EIS mapping with key on source
(see EIS One-to-Many Mappings with Key on Source).

Grouping Element

Specify the element in which foreign key pairs are grouped in the source
object’s EIS record. If you specify only one pair of source and target
XML fields, this is optional.

If you specify more than one pair of source and target XML fields, this
is required.

Field Pairs

Click Add to add a pair of source and target XML fields. Specify Field
Pair dialog box opens. Click Browse to add a foreign key for the Source
XPath and Target XPath fields.

== Configuring Delete All Interactions

The EclipseLink query and expression framework supports delete all
queries. If your JCA adapter provides access to an EIS Delete All
function, you can configure a delete all interaction to support
EclipseLink delete all queries.

=== How to Configure Delete All Interactions Using Workbench

To specify the DeleteAll interaction for an EIS one-to-many mapping, use
this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the mapped attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear
in the Editor.
. Click the *Delete All Interaction* tab. The Delete All Interaction tab
appears.[#Figure 80-2]## *_Delete All Interaction Tab_*
image:deletealltab.gif[Delete All Interaction
Tab,title="Delete All Interaction Tab"]
. Complete the fields on the Delete All Interaction tab.

Use the following information to enter data in each field on the Delete
All Interaction tab:

[width="100%",cols="<8%,<92%",options="header",]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Function Name* |The name of the EIS function that this call type (Read
Object or Read All) invokes on the EIS.

|*Input Record Name* |The name passed to the JCA adapter when creating
the input record.

|*Input Root Element Name* |The root element name to use for the input
DOM.

|*Input Arguments* |The query argument name to map to the interaction
field or XPath nodes in the argument record. For example, if you are
using XML records, use this option to map input argument `+name+` to the
XPath `+name/first-name+`.

|*Output Arguments* |The result record field or XPath nodes to map to
the correct nodes in the record used by the descriptor’s mappings. For
example, if you are using XML records, use this option to map the output
`+fname+` to `+name/first-name+`.Output arguments are not required if
the interaction returns an XML result that matches the descriptor’s
mappings.

|*Input Result Path* |Use this option if the EIS interaction expects the
interaction arguments to be nested in the XML record. For example,
specify `+arguments+`, if the arguments were to be nested under the root
element `+exec-find-order+`, then under an `+arguments+` element.

|*Output Result Path* |The name of the EIS function that this call type
(Read Object or Read All) invokes on the EIS.

|*Properties* |Any properties required by your EIS platform. For
example, property name `+operation+` (from
`+AQPlatform.QUEUE_OPERATION+`) and property value `+enqueue+` (from
`+AQPlatform.ENQUEUE+`).
