== Introduction to the Application Server Support

EclipseLink can be used with _any_ Java EE application server that meets
the link:#What_Are_the_Software_Requirements[software requirements]
through the EclipseLink API.

There is EclipseLink-specific integration support for the following
servers:

== Integrating EclipseLink with an Application Server

This section describes concepts unique to EclipseLink application server
integration, including the following:

* link:#What_Are_the_Software_Requirements[What Are the Software
Requirements]
* link:#How_to_Configure_the_XML_Parser_Platform[How to Configure the
XML Parser Platform]
* link:#How_to_Set_Security_Permissions[How to Set Security Permissions]
* link:#How_to_Integrate_Clustering[How to Integrate Clustering]

=== What Are the Software Requirements

To run a EclipseLink application within a Java EE container, your system
must meet the following software requirements:

* An application server or Java EE container
* XML parser (see link:#How_to_Configure_the_XML_Parser_Platform[How to
Configure the XML Parser Platform]);
* A JDBC driver configured to connect with your local database system
(for more information, see your database administrator);
* A Java development environment, such as the following:
** Eclipse IDE;
** Oracle JDeveloper;
** IBM WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD);
** Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5 or later;
* Any other Java environment that is compatible with the Sun JDK 1.5 or
later;
* A command-line JVM executable (such as `+java.exe+` or `+jre.exe+`).

=== How to Configure the XML Parser Platform

The EclipseLink run-time environment uses an XML parser to do the
following:

* Read and write XML configuration files (see
link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#project.xml_File[project.xml
File] "`wikilink`") and
link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml
File]);
* Read and write Workbench project files (see
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_Workbench[Introduction
to Workbench]);
* Perform object-to-XML transformations in EIS projects using XML
records (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Introduction to EIS
Mappings]);
* Perform object-to-XML transformations in XML projects (see
link:Introduction%20to%20XML%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Introduction to XML
Mappings]);

Application servers use an XML parser to read deployment files, such as
`+ejb-jar.xml+` and `+<+`__`+Java EE container+`__>`+-ejb-jar.xml+`
files (see
link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)[Creating
EclipseLink Files for Deployment]).

To avoid XML parser conflicts, you must configure your EclipseLink
application to use the same XML parser as that used by the application
server on which you deploy your application.

Internally, EclipseLink accesses its XML parser using an instance of
`+org.eclipse.persistence.platform.xml.XMLPlatform+` class.

You can configure EclipseLink to use any XML parser for which an
`+XMLPlatform+` class exists (see
link:#Configuring_XML_Parser_Platform[Configuring XML Parser Platform]).

You can also create your own `+XMLPlatform+` to provide access to an XML
parser not currently supported by EclipseLink (see
link:#Creating_an_XML_Parser_Platform[Creating an XML Parser Platform]).

==== Configuring XML Parser Platform

EclipseLink provides the `+XMLPlatform+` instances shown in the
following table.

[#table_7_1]## *_Supported XML Platforms_*

XMLPlatform…

Provides Access to…

Use with…

org.eclipse.persistence.platform.xml.xdk.XDKPlatform

XDKParser: this class provides access to the Oracle XML Developer’s Kit
(XDK) XML parser (see
http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/xml/xdkhome.html).

Integrating EclipseLink with Oracle Containers for J2EE (OC4J)

org.eclipse.persistence.platform.xml.jaxp.JAXPPlatform1

JAXPParser: this class provides access to the Java SDK XML parser in the
javax.xml.parsers package (see
http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/JAXPIntro2.html).

See the following:

Integrating EclipseLink with Oracle WebLogic Server

Integrating EclipseLink with IBM WebSphere Application Server

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: To use an XML parser not listed in this table, create your own
`+XMLPlatform+` (see link:#Creating_an_XML_Parser_Platform[Creating an
XML Parser Platform]).
|===

To configure your EclipseLink application to use a particular instance
of the `+XMLPlatform+` class, set system property
`+eclipse.persistence.xml.platform+` to the fully qualified name of your
`+XMLPlatform+` class, as the following example shows.

[#Example 7-1]## *_Configuring XML Platform_*

`+eclipse.persistence.xml.platform=org.eclipse.persistence.platform.xml.jaxp.JAXPPlatform+`

==== Creating an XML Parser Platform

Using the `+org.eclipse.persistence.internal.xml+` classes you can
create your own instance of the
`+org.eclipse.persistence.platform.xml.XMLPlatform+` class to specify an
XML parser not listed in the link:#table_7_1[Supported XML Platforms]
table.

After creating your `+XMLPlatform+`, configure EclipseLink to use it
(see link:#Configuring_XML_Parser_Platform[Configuring XML Parser
Platform]).

==== XML Parser Limitations

Crimson
(http://xml.apache.org/crimson/[`+http://xml.apache.org/crimson/+`]) is
the XML parser supplied in the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)
and in some JAXP reference implementations.

If you use Crimson with the JAXP API to parse XML files whose system
identifier is not a fully qualified URL, then XML parsing will fail with
a _not valid URL_ exception.

Other XML parsers defer validation of the system identifier URL until it
is specifically referenced.

If you are experiencing this problem, consider one of the following
alternatives:

* Ensure that your XML files use a fully qualified system identifier
URL.
* Use another XML parser (such as the OracleAS XML Parser for Java v2).

=== How to Set Security Permissions

By default, when you run a EclipseLink-enabled application in a JVM
configured with a nondefault `+java.lang.SecurityManager+`, the
EclipseLink run-time environment executes certain internal functions by
executing a `+PrivilegedAction+` with `+java.security.AccessController+`
method `+doPrivileged+`. This ensures that you do not need to grant many
permissions to EclipseLink for it to perform its most common operations.
You need only grant certain permissions depending on the types of
optional EclipseLink features you use.

For more information, see link:#Defining_Security_Permissions[Defining
Security Permissions].

If you run a EclipseLink-enabled application in a JVM without a
nondefault `+SecurityManager+`, you do not need to set any permissions.

=== How to Integrate Clustering

Most application servers include a clustering service that you can use
with your EclipseLink application.

To use EclipseLink with an application server cluster, use this general
procedure:

[arabic]
. Install the `+eclipselink.jar+` file (and include it in the classpath)
on each application server in the cluster to which you deploy
EclipseLink applications.
. Configure EclipseLink cache consistency options appropriate for your
application. For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)[Introduction to Cache].
. Configure clustering on each application server. For more information,
see your application server documentation.

== Integrating EclipseLink with Oracle WebLogic Server

To integrate an EclipseLink application with Oracle WebLogic Server, you
must consider the following:

* link:#How_to_Configure_the_WebLogic_Classpath[How to Configure the
WebLogic Classpath]
* link:#How_to_Integrate_with_the_WebLogic_JTA[How to Integrate with the
WebLogic JTA]

* link:#How_to_Integrate_the_Security_Manager[How to Integrate the
Security Manager]

In addition to configuring these Oracle WebLogic Server-specific
options, you must also consider the general application server
integration issues in
link:#Integrating_EclipseLink_with_an_Application_Server[Integrating
EclipseLink with an Application Server].

=== How to Configure the WebLogic Classpath

EclipseLink works out of the box in Oracle WebLogic Server 10.3. The
EclipseLink library resides in the following location on the server:

`+$BEA_HOME/modules/org.eclipse.persistence_*.jar+`

Ensure that your EclipseLink application defines an XML parser platform
(see link:#How_to_Configure_the_XML_Parser_Platform[How to Configure the
XML Parser Platform]).

=== How to Integrate with the WebLogic JTA

For applications that require JTA integration, specify the external
transaction controller when you configure the server platform in your
session (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_the_Server_Platform[Configuring
the Server Platform]).

For more information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)#Integrating_the_Unit_of_Work_with_an_External_Transaction_Service[Integrating
the Unit of Work with an External Transaction Service].

=== How to Integrate JMX

By default, when you deploy an EclipseLink application to Oracle
WebLogic Server, the EclipseLink runtime deploys the following Java
Management Extensions (JMX) MBeans to the Oracle WebLogic Server JMX
service for each EclipseLink session:

* `+org.eclipse.persistence.services.DevelopmentServices+` - This class
is meant to provide facilities for managing an EclipseLink session
internal to EclipseLink over JMX.
* `+org.eclipse.persistence.services.RuntimeServices+` - This class is
meant to provide facilities for managing an EclipseLink session external
to EclipseLink over JMX.

Use the API that this JMX MBean exposes to access and configure your
EclipseLink sessions at run time using JMX code that you write, or to
integrate your EclipseLink application with a third-party JMX management
application, such as JConsole.

==== Setting Up the Environment for EclipseLink JMX MBeans

Perform the following steps:

[arabic]
. *Set breakpoints:* the `+eclipselink.jar+` deployed in the
`+$WEBLOGIC_HOME/modules/org.eclipse.persistence_n.n.n.jar+` needs a
source attachment. You set a breakpoint on the `+undeploy+` method of
the `+org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.EntityManagerSetupImpl+`
pointing to the source JAR file or your workspace projects, and then
redeploy. This will result in any breakpoints set in the `+predeploy+`
method or prior to the first login to be hit.
. *Enable remote access on the Oracle WebLogic Server JVM* by adding the
following JVM option to your WebLogic startup script:
`+C:\opt\wls103\user_projects\domains\base_domain\bin\startWebLogic.cmd+`
`+set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote+`
. *Enable MBean registration (deployment)* by adding one or both of the
two MBean system properties, as follows:
`+rem set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -Declipselink.register.dev.mbean=true+`
`+rem set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -Declipselink.register.run.mbean=true+`
By default, EclipseLink does not register MBeans for Oracle WebLogic
Server. If you enable the registration, it will occur as a post step
during the first login to the session (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Session_Login[Configuring
a Session Login]). If both `+eclipselink.register.dev.mbean+` and
`+eclipselink.register.run.mbean+` properties are missing, MBean
registration will not proceed for that bean.
. *Configure Oracle WebLogic Server domain security*. For more
information, see
_http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/JPA/WebLogic_Web_Tutorial[EclipseLink
JMX MBean Support in Oracle WebLogic Server tutorial]_.

==== Accessing EclipseLink JMX MBeans Using a Third-Party JMX Management Application

After you deploy your EclipseLink application, you can use any
JMX-compliant management application to access and use the full public
API that EclipseLink MBeans provide.

*To access EclipseLink JMX MBeans using a third-party JMX management
application:*

[arabic]
. Package and deploy your EclipseLink application to Oracle WebLogic
Server. For more information, see
link:Deploying%20a%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Deploying an
EclipseLink Application].
. Optionally, examine Oracle WebLogic Server logs and look for the
appropriate log messages. Note that for a JPA application, EclipseLink
session instantiation and login occurs at `+EntityManager+`
instantiation time.
. Launch your third-party JMX management application. For example,
launch JConsole (`+JDK_HOME\bin\jconsole.exe+`) using the command
prompt, and then select the running `+weblogic.Server+` local process,
as the following figure shows.
+
.Image:Jconsole_attach_to_weblogic_server_jvm.jpg
image::Jconsole_attach_to_weblogic_server_jvm.jpg[Image:Jconsole_attach_to_weblogic_server_jvm.jpg,title="Image:Jconsole_attach_to_weblogic_server_jvm.jpg"]

[arabic]
. Optionally, launch JRockit Mission Control *JMC.exe*, attach to the
JVM process and navigate to the MBeans tab - you will see the following
screen showing the EclipsLink MBeans for your session.

.Image:Jrockit_jconsole_mbeans_via_non_jndi_generic_spec_lookup.JPG
image::Jrockit_jconsole_mbeans_via_non_jndi_generic_spec_lookup.JPG[Image:Jrockit_jconsole_mbeans_via_non_jndi_generic_spec_lookup.JPG,title="Image:Jrockit_jconsole_mbeans_via_non_jndi_generic_spec_lookup.JPG"]

==== Disabling EclipseLink JMX Support

There are a number of ways to disable EclipseLink JMX support.

*To disable deployment of MBeans to Oracle WebLogic Server for your
EclipseLink application using system properties*, remove, disable, or do
not add in the first place `+eclipselink.register.dev.mbean+` and
`+eclipselink.register.run.mbean+` MBean system properties. The
following example shows how to disable these properties:
`+rem set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -Declipselink.register.dev.mbean=false+`
`+rem set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -Declipselink.register.run.mbean=false+`.

*To disable deployment of MBeans to Oracle WebLogic Server for your
EclipseLink application using deployment XML*, use an EclipseLink
`+sessions.xml+` file (assuming your application has one):

[arabic]
. Undeploy your EclipseLink application on Oracle WebLogic Server.
. Edit your EclipseLink application’s Oracle WebLogic Server platform to
disable run-time services. For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_the_Server_Platform[Configuring
the Server Platform].
. Package your EclipseLink application and redeploy on Oracle WebLogic
Server. For more information, see
link:Deploying%20a%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Deploying an
EclipseLink Application].
. Confirm that EclipseLink JMX MBean instances for your application no
longer exist.

If your application does not include an EclipseLink `+sessions.xml+`
file, you can use a `+preLogin+` event handler to disable this feature
(see the following section).

*To disable deployment of MBeans to Oracle WebLogic Server for your
EclipseLink application using the EclipseLink session preLogin event
handler*:

[arabic]
. Undeploy your EclipseLink application on Oracle WebLogic Server.
. Create an EclipseLink session customizer. For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Session_Customizer_Class[Configuring
a Session Customizer Class].
. In your session customizer, create a session event listener for the
`+preLogin+` session event and register the listener with the session
event manager, as the following example shows.
+
`+import oracle.eclipselink.tools.sessionconfiguration.SessionCustomizer;+`
`+import oracle.eclipselink.sessions.Session;+`
`+import oracle.eclipselink.sessions.SessionEvent;+`
`+import oracle.eclipselink.sessions.SessionEventAdapter;+`
`+import oracle.eclipselink.platform.server.ServerPlatform;+`
`+public class EmployeeSessionCustomizer implements SessionCustomizer {+`
`+  +` `+  public void customize(Sesssion session) {+`
`+      SessionEventAdapter myEventListener = new SessionEventAdapter() {+`
`+          +`*`+//\'\' \'\'Listen\'\' \'\'for\'\' \'\'preLogin\'\' \'\'event+`*
`+          public void preLogin(SessionEvent event) {+`
`+              +`*`+//\'\' \'\'Disable\'\' \'\'runtime\'\' \'\'services+`*
`+              Session session event.getSession();+`
`+              ServerPlatform serverPlatform = session.getServerPlatform();+`
`+              serverPlatform.disableRuntimeServices();+`
`+          }+` `+      };+`
`+      +`*`+//\'\' \'\'Register\'\' \'\'session\'\' \'\'event\'\' \'\'listener+`*
`+      session.getEventManager().addListener(myEventListener);+`
`+  }+` `+}+`
+
For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Session_Event_Listeners[Configuring
Session Event Listeners].
. Package your EclipseLink application, including your session
customizer, and redeploy on Oracle WebLogic Server. For more
information, see
link:Packaging%20a%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Packaging an
EclipseLink Application] and
link:Deploying%20a%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Deploying an
EclipseLink Application].
. Confirm that EclipseLink JMX MBean instances for your application are
not deployed.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: Follow the preceding procedure if you EclipseLink application
does not include an Oracle WebLogic Server `+sessions.xml+` file (such
as a EclipseLink JPA application).

==== What You May Need to Know About EclipseLink JMX Support

For more information on EclipseLink and Oracle WebLogic Server JMX
support, see the following:

* Oracle WebLogic Server: Developing Manageable Applications with JMX
* Oracle WebLogic Server: Developing Custom Management Utilities with
JMX

For more information on JMX in general, see
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jmx/index.html

=== How to Integrate the Security Manager

If you use a security manager, specify a security policy file in the
`+weblogic.policy+` file (normally located in the WebLogic install
directory), as follows:

`+-Djava.security.manager+`
`+-Djava.security.policy==c:\weblogic\weblogic.policy+`

The WebLogic installation procedure includes a sample security policy
file. You need to edit the `+weblogic.policy+` file to grant permission
for EclipseLink to use reflection.

The following example illustrates only the permissions that EclipseLink
requires, but most `+weblogic.policy+` files contain more permissions
than are shown in this example.

[#Example 7-5]## *_A Subset of a "`Grant`" Section from a
WebLogic.policy File_*

[source,java]
----
 grant {
 '''// "enableSubstitution" required to run the WebLogic console'''
 permission java.io.SerializablePermission "enableSubstitution";
 '''// "modifyThreadGroup" required to run the WebLogic Server'''
 permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThreadGroup";
 '''// grant permission for EclipseLink to use reflection'''

     permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
 };
----

depending on what version of this server you are using:

==== Configuring Classpath for IBM WebSphere Application Server 6.1 and Later

EclipseLink provides JTA and general integration support for IBM
WebSphere application server 6.1 and later. To configure the classpath
for this version, do the following:

[arabic]
. Create a shared library that contains the
__`+\jlib\eclipselink.jar''+` file and associate the shared library with
the application.
. Ensure that your EclipseLink application defines an XML parser
platform (see link:#How_to_Configure_the_XML_Parser_Platform[How to
Configure the XML Parser Platform]).

=== How to Configure Class Loader Order

If you are deploying a EclipseLink enabled application that uses
EclipseLink `+sessions.xml+` or XML project deployment, you must use the
WebSphere Application Server Administrative Console to set *Class loader
order* to *Class loaded with application class loader first*.

=== How to Integrate with the WebSphere JTA

For applications that require JTA integration, specify the external
transaction controller when you configure the server platform in your
session (see

=== How to Configure JPA Application Deployment to JBoss 4.2 Application Server

For JPA applications, to enable the container to manage entities,
statically weave the entities and reference JBoss as the target server
in the `+persistence.xml+` file.

Perform the following deployment changes:

[arabic]
. If weaving is required, statically weave the entities before EAR
packaging. Use either the command-line weaver or the weaving Ant task
(see
link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)#How_to_Configure_Static_Weaving_for_JPA_Entities[How
to Configure Static Weaving for JPA Entities]).
. Ensure that the `+eclipselink.target-server+` property (see
link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)#Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_for_Session,_Target_Database_and_Target_Application_Server[Using
EclipseLink JPA Extensions for Session&#44; Target Database and Target
Application Server]) is set in the `+persistence.xml+` file of all
persistence units deployed to the JBoss container:
+
+
Otherwise, even though the container-managed entities are predeployed,
they will not be managed at run time.

* link:#How_to_Integrate_with_the_NetWeaver_JTA[How to Integrate with
the NetWeaver JTA]

In addition to configuring these NetWeaver-specific options, you must
also consider the general application server integration issues in
link:#Integrating_EclipseLink_with_an_Application_Server[Integrating
EclipseLink with an Application Server].

=== How to Configure the NetWeaver Classpath

To configure EclipseLink support for NetWeaver, do the following:

[arabic]
. Create and deploy a standard library (i.e. an SDA file) that contains
the __`+\jlib\eclipselink.jar+` file and associate the library with the
application.
. Ensure that your EclipseLink application defines an XML parser
platform (see link:#How_to_Configure_the_XML_Parser_Platform[How to
Configure the XML Parser Platform]).

=== How to Integrate with the NetWeaver JTA

For applications that require JTA integration, specify the external
transaction controller when you configure the server platform in your
session. See
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_the_Server_Platform[Configuring
the Server Platform] for general information on configuring the server
platform and
link:EclipseLink_Development_ServerPlatform_NetweaverPlatform[EclipseLink/Development/ServerPlatform/NetweaverPlatform]
for a description of the NetWeaver server platform.

the Unit of Work with an External Transaction Service].

== Defining Security Permissions

By default, when you run a EclipseLink-enabled application in a JVM
configured with a nondefault `+java.lang.SecurityManager+`, the
EclipseLink run time executes certain internal functions by executing a
`+PrivilegedAction+` with `+java.security.AccessController+` method
`+doPrivileged+`. This ensures that you do not need to grant many
permissions to EclipseLink for it to perform its most common operations.
You need only grant certain permissions depending on the types of
optional EclipseLink features you use (see
link:#How_to_Define_Permissions_Required_by_EclipseLink_Features[How to
Define Permissions Required by EclipseLink Features]).

While using `+doPrivileged+` method provides enhanced security, it will
severely impact overall performance. Alternatively, you can configure
EclipseLink to disable the use of `+doPrivileged+` method even when a
nondefault `+SecurityManager+` is present (see
link:#How_to_Disable_doPrivileged_Operation[How to Disable doPrivileged
Operation]). In this case, you must grant EclipseLink all required
permissions (see
link:#How_to_Define_Permissions_Required_by_EclipseLink_Features[How to
Define Permissions Required by EclipseLink Features] and
link:#How_to_Define_Permissions_Required_when_doPrivileged_Is_Disabled[How
to Define Permissions Required when doPrivileged Is Disabled]).

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: While enabling the use of `+doPriviledged+` method enhances
EclipseLink application security, it does not guarantee that secure code
cannot be called by application code in ways that the system did not
intend. You must consider the use of `+doPriviledged+` method within the
context of your overall application security strategy. For more
information, see
http://java.sun.com/security/index.jsp[`+http://java.sun.com/security/index.jsp+`].
|===

If you run a EclipseLink-enabled application in a JVM without a
nondefault `+SecurityManager+`, you do not need to grant any
permissions.

=== How to Define Permissions Required by EclipseLink Features

When you run a EclipseLink-enabled application in a JVM configured with
a nondefault `+java.lang.SecurityManager+` and `+doPrivileged+`
operation is enabled, you may need to grant additional permissions if
your application requires any of the following:

* link:#Defining_System_Properties[Defining System Properties]
* link:#Loading_project.xml_or_sessions.xml_Files[Loading project.xml or
sessions.xml Files]
* link:#Defining_Cache_Coordination[Defining Cache Coordination]
* link:#Accessing_a_Data_Source_by_Port[Accessing a Data Source by Port]
* link:#Logging_with_java.util.logging[Logging with java.util.logging]
* link:#Granting_Permissions_for_Java_EE_Application_Deployment[Granting
Permissions for Java EE Application Deployment]

==== Defining System Properties

By default, a EclipseLink-enabled application requires access to the
system properties granted in the default
`+<+`_`+JAVA_HOME+`_`+>/lib/security/java.policy+` file. If your
application requires access to other platform-specific, environment, or
custom properties, then grant further `+PropertyPermission+`
permissions, as the following example shows.

[#Example 7-6]## *_Permissions for System Properties_*

`+permission java.util.PropertyPermission "my.property", "read";+`

==== Loading project.xml or sessions.xml Files

Most EclipseLink-enabled applications read in `+project.xml+` and
`+sessions.xml+` files directly. Grant permissions to the specific files
or file locations, as the following example shows. This example assumes
that both `+project.xml+` and `+sessions.xml+` files are located in the
same directory (given by application-specific system property
`+deployment.xml.home+`). Alternatively, you can specify a separate
`+FilePermission+` for each file.

[#Example 7-7]## *_Permissions for Loading Deployment XML Files_*

`+permission java.io.FilePermission "${deployment.xml.home}/*.xml", "read";+`

For information on `+FilePermission+` settings for Java EE applications,
see
link:#Granting_Permissions_for_Java_EE_Application_Deployment[Granting
Permissions for Java EE Application Deployment].

==== Defining Cache Coordination

If your application uses cache coordination (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)#Cache_Coordination[Cache
Coordination]), then grant `+accept+`, `+connect+`, `+listen+`, and
`+resolve+` permissions to the specific sockets used by your coordinated
cache, as the following example shows. This example assumes that the
coordinated cache multicast port (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Coordinated%20Cache%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Multicast_Port[Configuring
a Multicast Port]) is 1024.

[#Example 7-8]## *_Permissions for Cache Coordination_*

`+permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:1024-", "accept, connect, listen, resolve";+`

==== Accessing a Data Source by Port

If your EclipseLink-enabled application accesses a data source using a
socket, then grant `+connect+` and `+resolve+` permissions for that
socket, as the following example shows. This example assumes that the
host name (or IP address) of the remote host that provides the data
source (such as a relational database server host) is given by
application-specific system property `+remote.data.source.host+` and
that this host accepts data source connections on port 1025.

[#Example 7-9]## *_Permissions for non-Java EE Data Source Connections_*

`+permission java.net.SocketPermission "${remote.data.source.host}:1025-", "connect, resolve";+`

For Java EE applications, data source socket permissions are usually
handled by the application server.

==== Logging with java.util.logging

If you configure your EclipseLink-enabled application to use
`+java.util.logging+` package (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Logging[Configuring
Logging]), then grant your application `+control+` permissions, as this
example shows.

[#Example 7-10]## *_Permissions for java.util.logging_*

`+permission java.util.logging.LoggingPermission "control"+`

==== Granting Permissions for Java EE Application Deployment

If you are deploying a EclipseLink-enabled Java EE application, you must
grant permissions for the following:

* The `+eclipselink.jar+` file. For example:

`+grant codeBase "file:+``+/jlib/eclipselink.jar" {+`
`+    permission java.security.AllPermission;+` `+};+`

If you are using an XML platform, you must also grant the following
permissions:

* The `+eclipse.persistence.xml.platform+` system property. For Example:

`+permission java.util.PropertyPermission "eclipse.persistence.xml.platform", "read"+`

=== How to Define Permissions Required when doPrivileged Is Disabled

If you disable `+doPrivileged+` operation when you run a
EclipseLink-enabled application in a JVM configured with a nondefault
`+java.lang.SecurityManager+`, you must grant the following permissions:

* `+java.lang.reflect.RelectPermission "suppressAccessChecks"+`
* `+java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers"+`
* `+java.lang.RuntimePermission "getClassLoader"+`

You may also have to grant additional permissions depending on the
EclipseLink features your application uses. For more information, see
link:#How_to_Define_Permissions_Required_by_EclipseLink_Features[How to
Define Permissions Required by EclipseLink Features].

=== How to Disable doPrivileged Operation

To disable `+doPrivileged+` operation when you run a EclipseLink-enabled
application in a JVM configured with a nondefault
`+java.lang.SecurityManager+`, set system property
`+oracle.j2ee.security.usedoprivileged+` to `+false+`. If you are using
OC4J, set system property `+oracle.j2ee.security.usedoprivileged+` to
`+false+`.

To enable `+doPrivileged+` operation, set these system properties to
`+true+`.
