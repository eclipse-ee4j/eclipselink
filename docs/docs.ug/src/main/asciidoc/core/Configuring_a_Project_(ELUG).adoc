=== How to Configure Project Save Location Using Workbench

The Project Save Location field on the project’s General tab is for
display only. This field shows the full directory path for the project.
All relative locations used in the project are based on this location.

To select a new location, right-click on the project in the *Navigator*
and select *Save As* from the context menu. See
link:Creating%20a%20Project%20(ELUG)#How_to_Save_Projects[How to Save
Projects] for more information.

== Configuring Project Classpath

The EclipseLink project uses a classpath – a set of directories, JAR
files, and ZIP files – when importing Java classes and defining object
types.

This table summarizes which projects support project classpath
configuration.

[#Table 113-4]##

Descriptor

Using the Workbench

Using Java

Relational Projects

Do not include JDBC drivers or other elements required to access the
data source in the project classpath. Use the `+setenv+` file to specify
these application-level settings (see
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Configuring_the_Workbench_Environment[Configuring
the Workbench Environment]).

After you configure the project classpath, you can use Workbench to
import classes into your project (see
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#How_to_Import_and_Update_Classes[How to
Import and Update Classes]).

=== How to Configure Project Classpath Using Workbench

To specify the project classpath information, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the project object in the *Navigator*.
. Click the *General* tab in the *Editor*. The General tab appears.
[#Figure 113-2]##*_General Tab, Classpath Options_*
image:genclassp.gif[General Tab, Classpath
Options,title="General Tab, Classpath Options"]

To add a new classpath entry, click *Add Entry* or *Browse* and select
the directory, `+.jar+` file, or `+.zip+` file for this project. To
create a relative classpath, select an entry and edit the path, as
necessary. The path will be relative to the *Project Save Location*.

To remove a classpath entry, select the entry and click *Remove*.

To change the order of the entries, select the entry and click *Up* or
*Down*.

== Configuring Method or Direct Field Access at the Project Level

By default, when EclipseLink performs a persistence operation, it
accesses the persistent attributes of an object directly: this is known
as direct field access. Alternatively, you can configure EclipseLink to
access persistent attributes using accessor methods of the object: this
is known as method access.

We recommend using field access for mappings. Not only is it more
efficient, but using method access may cause issues if the method
produces unexpected side-effects.

This table summarizes which projects support mapped field access
configuration.

[#Table 113-5]##

Descriptor

Using the Workbench

Using Java

Relational Projects

EIS Projects

XML Projects

This section describes configuring mapped field access at the project
level: by default, this configuration applies to all descriptors and
their mappings.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: If you change the access default, existing mappings retain
their current access settings, but new mappings will be created with the
new default.
|===

You can also configure mapped field access at the mapping level to
override this project-level configuration on a mapping-by-mapping basis.
For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Method_or_Direct_Field_Accessing_at_the_Mapping_Level[Configuring
Method or Direct Field Accessing at the Mapping Level].

If you enable change tracking on a property (for example, you decorate
method `+getPhone+` with `+@ChangeTracking+`) and you access the field
(`+phone+`) directly, note that EclipseLink does not detect the change.
For more information, see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink%20Application%20Development%20(ELUG)#Using_Method_and_Direct_Field_Access[Using
Method and Direct Field Access].

=== How to Configure Method or Direct Field Access at the Project Level Using Workbench

To specify the field access method information, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the project object in the *Navigator*.
. Select the *Defaults* tab in the *Editor*. The Defaults tab appears.
[#Figure 113-3]##*_Defaults Tab, Field Accessing Options_*
image:genfield.gif[Defaults Tab, Field Accessing
Options,title="Defaults Tab, Field Accessing Options"]
. Complete the Mapped Field Accessing options.

== Configuring Default Descriptor Advanced Properties

You can configure default descriptor advanced properties when using the
Workbench.

By default, Workbench displays a subset of features for each descriptor
type. You can modify this subset so that descriptors include additional
advanced properties by default.

You can also select specific advanced properties for individual
descriptors (see link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring
a Descriptor]).

This table summarizes which projects support default descriptor advanced
property configuration.

== Configuring Existence Checking at the Project Level

When EclipseLink writes an object to the database, it runs an existence
check to determine whether to perform an insert or an update operation.

By default, EclipseLink checks against the cache. We recommend that you
use this default existence check option for most applications. Checking
the database for existence can cause a performance bottleneck in your
application.

This table summarizes which projects support existence checking
configuration.

Use this table to enter data in following fields to specify the
existence checking options for newly created descriptors:

[width="100%",cols="<7%,<93%",options="header",]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Check Cache* |Check the session cache. If the object is not in the
cache, assume that the object does not exist (do an insert). If the
object is in the cache, assume that the object exists (do an update). We
recommend using this option for most applications.

|*Check Database* |If an object is not in the cache, query the database
to determine if the object exists. If the object exists, do an update.
Otherwise, do an insert. Selecting this option may negatively impact
performance. For more information, see

== Configuring Model Java Source Code Options

You can configure model java source code options when using the
Workbench.

Using Workbench, you can specify the default file names, class names,
and directories, when exporting or generating Java source code for your
domain objects. Directories are relative to the project save location

== Configuring Cache Type and Size at the Project Level

The EclipseLink cache is an in-memory repository that stores recently
read or written objects based on class and primary key values.
EclipseLink uses the cache to achieve the following:

* improve performance by holding recently read or written objects and
accessing them in-memory to minimize database access;
* manage locking and isolation level;
* manage object identity.

This table summarizes which projects support identity map configuration.

[#'Table 113-10]## *_Project Support for Identity Map Configuration_*

Descriptor

Using the Workbench

Using Java

Relational Projects

EIS Projects

XML Projects

The cache options you configure at the project level apply globally to
all descriptors. Use this section to define global cache options for an
EclipseLink project.

You can override the project-level identity map configuration by
defining identity map configuration at the descriptor level. For
information on caching and defining identity map configuration for a
specific descriptor, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Cache_Type_and_Size_at_the_Descriptor_Level[Configuring
Cache Type and Size at the Descriptor Level].

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: When using Workbench, changing the project’s default identity
map does not affect descriptors that already exist in the project; only
newly added descriptors ar affected.
|===

For detailed information on caching and object identity, and the
recommended settings to maximize EclipseLink performance, see to
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)#Cache_Type_and_Object_Identity[Cache
Type and Object Identity].

For more information about the cache, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)[Introduction to Cache].

=== How to Configure Cache Type and Size at the Project Level Using Workbench

To specify the cache identity map, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the project object in the *Navigator*.
. Select the *Defaults* tab in the *Editor*. The Defaults tab appears.
[#Figure 113-8]##*_Defaults Tab, Cache Identity Map Options_*
image:projident.gif[Defaults Tab, Cache Identity Map
Options,title="Defaults Tab, Cache Identity Map Options"]
. Complete the *Caching* options on the tab.

Use this table to enter data in each of the following fields to specify
the caching options:

Field

Description

Type

Use the Type list to choose the identity map as follows:

Weak with Soft Subcache – cache first n elements in soft space, anything
after that in weak space (see SoftCacheWeakIdentityMap).

Weak with Hard Subcache – cache first n elements in soft space, anything
after that in hard space (see HardCacheWeakIdentityMap).

Weak – cache everything in weak space (see WeakIdentityMap).

Soft – cache everything in soft space (see SoftIdentityMap).

Full – cache everything permanently (see FullIdentityMap).

None – cache nothing (see No Identity Map|NoIdentityMap).

For more information, see Cache Type and Object Identity.

Changing the project’s default identity map does not affect descriptors
that already exist in the project.

Size

Specify the size of the cache as follows:

When using Weak with Soft Subcache or Weak with Hard Subcache, the size
is the maximum number of objects stored in the identity map.

When using Full or Weak, the size indicates the starting size of the
identity map.

=== How to Configure Cache Type and Size at the Project Level Using Java

Use one of the following `+ClassDescriptor+` methods to configure the
descriptor to use the appropriate type of identity map:

* `+useFullIdentitMap+`
* `+useWeakIdentitMap+`
* `+useSoftIdentitMap+`
* `+useSoftCacheWeakIdentitMap+`
* `+useHardCacheWeakIdentityMap+`
* `+useNoIdentityMap+`

Use the `+ClassDescriptor+` method `+setIdentityMapSize+` to configure
the size of the identity map.

== Configuring Cache Isolation at the Project Level

If you plan to use isolated sessions (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)#Cache_Isolation[Cache
Isolation]), you must configure descriptors as isolated for any object
that you want confined to an isolated session cache.

Configuring a descriptor to be isolated means that EclipseLink will not
store the object in the shared session cache and the object will not be
shared across client sessions. This means that each client will have
their own object read directly from the database. Objects in an isolated
client session cache can reference objects in their parent server
session’s shared session cache, but no objects in the shared session
cache can reference objects in an isolated client session cache.
Isolation is required when using Oracle Database Virtual Private
Database (VPD) support or database user-based read security. Isolation
can also be used if caching is not desired across client sessions.

This table summarizes which projects support cache isolation
configuration.

. Complete the Isolation option on the tab. Use the *Isolation* list to
choose one of the following:
* *Isolated* – if you want all objects confined to an isolated client
session cache. For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)#Cache_Isolation[Cache
Isolation].
* *Shared* – if you want all objects visible in the shared session cache
(default).

== Configuring Cache Coordination Change Propagation at the Project Level

If you plan to use a coordinated cache (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)#Cache_Coordination[Cache
Coordination]), you can configure how and under what conditions a
coordinated cache propagates changes.

This table summarizes which projects support cache coordination change
propagation configuration.

Use the following information to enter data in the Coordination field:

[width="100%",cols="<8%,<59%,<33%",options="header",]
|===
|*Coordination Option* |*Description* |*When to Use*
|*None* |For both existing and new instances, do not propagate a change
notification. |Infrequently read or changed objects.

|*Synchronize Changes* |For an existing instance, propagate a change
notification that contains each changed attribute. For a new instance,
propagate an object creation (along with all the new instance’s
attributes) only if the new instance is related to other existing
objects that are also configured with this change propagation option.
|Frequently read or changed objects that contain few attributes or in
cases where only a few attributes are frequently changed. Objects that
have many or complex relationships.

|*Synchronize Changes and New Objects* |For an existing instance,
propagate a change notification that contains each changed attribute.
For a new instance, propagate an object creation (along with all the new
instance’s attributes). |Frequently read or changed objects that contain
few attributes or in cases where only a few attributes are frequently
changed. Objects that have few or simple relationships.

|*Invalidate Changed Objects* |For an existing instance, propagate an
object invalidation that marks the object as invalid in all other
sessions. This tells other sessions that they must update their cache
from the data source the next time this object is read. For a new
instance, no change notification is propagated. |Frequently read or
changed objects that contain many attributes in cases where many of the
attributes are frequently changed.
|===

== Configuring Cache Expiration at the Project Level

By default, objects remain in the cache until they are explicitly
deleted (see
link:Using%20Basic%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)#Deleting_Objects[Deleting
Objects]) or garbage-collected when using a weak identity map (see
link:#Configuring_Cache_Type_and_Size_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Cache Type and Size at the Project Level]). Alternatively, you can
configure an object with a `+CacheInvalidationPolicy+` that lets you
specify, either automatically or manually, that an object is invalid:
when any query attempts to read an invalid object, EclipseLink will go
to the data source for the most up-to-date version of that object and
update the cache with this information.

Using cache invalidation ensures that your application does not use
stale data. It provides a better performing alternative to refreshing
(see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Cache_Refreshing[Configuring
Cache Refreshing]).

This table summarizes which projects support cache invalidation
configuration.

invalidation options for an EclipseLink project.

You can override the project-level cache invalidation configuration by
defining cache invalidation at the descriptor (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Cache_Expiration_at_the_Descriptor_Level[Configuring

You can customize how EclipseLink communicates the fact that an object
has been declared invalid to improve efficiency if you are using a
coordinated cache. For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Cache_Coordination_Change_Propagation_at_the_Descriptor_Level[Configuring

|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*No Expiry* |Specify that objects in the cache do not expire.

|*Time to Live Expiry* |Specify that objects in the cache will expire
after a specified amount of time. Use the *Expire After* field to
indicate the time (in milliseconds) after which the objects will expire.

|*Daily Expiry* |Specify that objects in the cache will expire at a
specific time each day. Use the *Expire At* field to indicate the exact
time to the second (using a 24-hour clock) at which the objects will
expire.

|*Update Read Time on Update* |Specify if the expiry time should be
reset after updating an object.
|===

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
