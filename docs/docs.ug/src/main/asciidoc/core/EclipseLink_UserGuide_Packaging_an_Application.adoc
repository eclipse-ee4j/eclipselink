How you package the components of your application depends on the type
of application and how you plan to deploy it.

This section describes EclipseLink-specific details applicable to the
common packaging strategies used for various types of applications.

|*Note:* If you are using EJB 3.0, you may be using annotations instead
of some deployment files. Include deployment descriptors to override
annotations or specify options not supported by annotations.

== Packaging Java Applications

For non-Java EE Java applications, it is common to package the
application in a single JAR file, as this example shows.

[#Example 9-1]## *_Packaging a non-Java EE Java Application_*

`+ domain_module.jar+`
`+     Java classes that represent the objects mapped+`
`+     project.xml+` `+     session.xml+` `+     META-INF+`
`+         Manifest.mf+`

This JAR contains the EclipseLink files and domain objects required by
the application, including the following:

* link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml
File];
* link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#project.xml_File[project.xml
File] (or the compiled `+Project+` class file if you are not using XML
files for deployment);
* The mapped classes required by the application, in a fully-resolved
directory structure.

When you create the JAR file, the JAR building utility automatically
creates a directory structure within the JAR. Ensure that the
`+sessions.xml+` file and the `+project.xml+` file (or project class
file) appear at the root of the JAR file. Ensure that the class
directory structure starts at the root of the JAR.

If you do not store the `+project.xml+` or `+sessions.xml+` files at the
root of the JAR file, see
link:#Packaging_with_EclipseLink_Metadata_File_Resource_Paths[Packaging
with EclipseLink Metadata File Resource Paths].

== Packaging JavaServer Pages and Servlet Applications

For simple Java EE applications without EJB, it is common to package the
application in an Enterprise Archive (EAR) file made up of various Java
EE application component archives, as this example shows.

[#Example 9-2]## *_Packaging a Java EE JSP or Servlet Application
Without EJB_*

`+ appname.ear+` `+     META-INF+` `+         application.xml+`
`+         orion-application.xml+` `+     domain_module.jar+`
`+         Java classes that represent the object mapped+`
`+         project.xml+` `+         session.xm+` `+         META-INF+`
`+             Manifest.mf+` `+     web_module.war+`
`+         html pages, JSP’s, etc.+` `+         META-INF+`
`+             web.xml+` `+             orion-web.xml+`
`+         classes+` `+             servlet classes+` `+         lib+`
`+     client_module.jar+` `+         Client classes+`
`+         META-INF+` `+             application-client.xml+`
`+             orion-application-client.xml+`

The component archives with EclipseLink dependencies include EclipseLink
domain JAR (see link:#How_to_Create_the_EclipseLink_Domain_JAR[How to
Create the EclipseLink Domain JAR]).

=== How to Create the EclipseLink Domain JAR

The domain JAR contains the EclipseLink files and domain objects
required by the application, including the following:

* link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml
File];
* link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#project.xml_File[project.xml
File] (or the compiled `+Project+` class file, if you are not using XML
files for deployment);
* The mapped classes required by the application, in a fully resolved
directory structure.

When you create the JAR file, the JAR building utility automatically
creates a directory structure within the JAR. Ensure that the
`+sessions.xml+` file and the `+project.xml+` file (or `+project.class+`
file) appear at the root of the JAR file. Also ensure that the class
directory structure starts at the root of the JAR.

If you do not store the `+project.xml+` or `+sessions.xml+` files at the
root of the JAR file, see
link:#Packaging_with_EclipseLink_Metadata_File_Resource_Paths[Packaging
with EclipseLink Metadata File Resource Paths].

== Packaging Session Bean Applications

This section contains information on
link:#How_to_Package_an_EJB_3.0_Session_Bean_Application[How to Package
an EJB 3.0 Session Bean Application].

=== How to Package an EJB 3.0 Session Bean Application

For information on how to package an EJB 3.0 session bean application,
see
link:Packaging_and_Deploying_EclipseLink_JPA_Applications_(ELUG)[Packaging
a EclipseLink JPA Application].

=== How to Create the EclipseLink Domain JAR

The domain JAR contains the EclipseLink files and domain objects
required by the application, including the following:

* `+sessions.xml+` (see
link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml
File]);
* `+project.xml+` (see
link:Creating%20EclipseLink%20Files%20for%20Deployment%20(ELUG)#project.xml_File[project.xml
File]) (or the compiled `+Project.class+` file if you are not using XML
files for deployment);
* The mapped classes required by the application, in a fully-resolved
directory structure.

When you create the JAR file, the JAR building utility automatically
creates a directory structure within the JAR. Ensure that the
`+sessions.xml+` file and the `+project.xml+` file (or `+project.class+`
file) appear at the root of the JAR file. Also ensure that the class
directory structure starts at the root of the JAR.

If you do not store the `+project.xml+` or `+sessions.xml+` files at the
root of the JAR file, see
link:#Packaging_with_EclipseLink_Metadata_File_Resource_Paths[Packaging
with EclipseLink Metadata File Resource Paths].

== Packaging JPA Applications

See
link:Packaging_and_Deploying_EclipseLink_JPA_Applications_(ELUG)[Packaging
a EclipseLink JPA Application] for information on how to package your
JPA application.

== Packaging a POJO Application for Weaving

To package a POJO application for weaving, you create a JAR that
contains a `+sessions.xml+` file and a `+persistence.xml+` file.

For more information on weaving, see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink%20Application%20Development%20(ELUG)[To
Package a POJO Application for Weaving].

== Packaging with EclipseLink Metadata File Resource Paths

If you do not store the `+project.xml+` or `+sessions.xml+` files at the
root of the JAR file, then you must provide the full resource path to
the files when accessing them. Ensure that you use "``+/+``" in
resources paths, not "``+\+``". Using "``+\+``" will not work in Java.

For example, in the `+jar+` element, reference the `+project.xml+` and
`+sessions.xml+` files as follows:

`+/myapp/ordersys/persist/sessions.xml+`
`+/myapp/ordersys/persist/project.xml+`

In the `+sessions.xml+` file, reference the `+project.xml+` as follows:

`+myapp/ordersys/persist/project.xml+`

To acquire the session, use the following:

[source,java]
----
 SessionManager.getManager().getSession(
     new XMLSessionConfigLoader("myapp/ordersys/persist/sessions.xml"),
     "OrdersysSession",
     getClass().getClassLoader()
 );
----

For more information about acquiring sessions at run time, see
link:Acquiring%20and%20Using%20Sessions%20at%20Run%20Time%20(ELUG)[Acquiring
a Session from the Session Manager].

== Packaging Directories with a Dot (.)

When packaging applications, avoid using a dot (.) in a directory in a
WAR file as this may cause deployment to fail. For example, if your WAR
includes:

`+WEB-INF/classes/.foo/jsp_servlet/bar.jspx+`

deployment may fail during persistence unit processing because the
application could not find a class named .foo.jsp_servlet.bar.jspx.
