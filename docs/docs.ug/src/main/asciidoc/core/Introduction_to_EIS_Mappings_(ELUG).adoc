EclipseLink enterprise information system (EIS) mappings provide support
for accessing legacy data sources and enterprise applications through
Java EE Connector architecture (JCA) adapter. EclipseLink EIS mappings
use the JCA Common Client Interface (CCI) to access the EIS through its
resource adapter. This provides the ability to directly map from an
existing Java object model to any transactional data source, such as
mainframes with flat file/hierarchical data.

An EIS mapping transforms object data members to the EIS record format
defined by the object’s descriptor.

For information on mapping concepts and features common to more than one
type of EclipseLink mappings, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Introduction to Mappings].

== EIS Mapping Types

EclipseLink supports the EIS mappings listed in this table.

[#Table 73-1]##

EIS Mapping Type

Description

EclipseLink Workbench

Java

EIS Direct Mapping

Map a simple object attribute directly to an EIS record.

EIS Composite Direct Collection Mapping

Map a collection of Java attributes directly to an EIS record.

EIS Composite Object Mapping

Map a Java object to an EIS record in a privately owned one-to-one
relationship. Composite object mappings represent a relationship between
two classes.

EIS Composite Collection Mapping

Map a Map or Collection of Java objects to an EIS record in a privately
owned one-to-many relationship.

EIS One-to-One Mapping

Define a reference mapping that represents the relationship between a
single source object and a single mapped persistent Java object.

EIS One-to-Many Mapping

Define a reference mapping that represents the relationship between a
single source object and a collection of mapped persistent Java objects.

EIS Transformation Mapping

Create custom mappings where one or more EIS record fields can be used
to create the object to be stored in a Java class’s attribute.

== EIS Mapping Concepts

This section describes concepts unique to EclipseLink EIS mappings,
including the following:

* link:#EIS_Record_Type[EIS Record Type]
* link:#XPath_Support[XPath Support]
* #xsd:list_and_xsd:union_Support[xsd:list and xsd:union Support]
* #jaxb:class_Support[jaxb:class Support]
* link:#Typesafe_Enumeration_Support[Typesafe Enumeration Support]
* link:#Composite_and_Reference_EIS_Mappings[Composite and Reference EIS
Mappings]
* link:#EIS_Mapping_Architecture[EIS Mapping Architecture]

=== EIS Record Type

EclipseLink supports the following JCA EIS record types:

* link:#Indexed_Records[Indexed Records]
* link:#Mapped_Records[Mapped Records]
* link:#[XML RecordsXML Records]

You configure the record type at the EIS descriptor level (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Record_Format[Configuring
Record Format]). EIS mappings use the record type of their EIS
descriptor to determine how to map Java attributes. That is, you use the
same EIS mapping regardless of the record type, with which you configure
an EIS descriptor.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* Not all JCA adapters support all record types. Consult your JCA
adapter documentation for details.
|===

==== Indexed Records

The `+javax.resource.cci.IndexedRecord+` represents an ordered
collection of record elements based on the `+java.util.List+` interface.

The EclipseLink runtime maps Java objects to indexed record elements or
subrecords of an indexed record depending on the type of EIS mapping you
use (see link:#Composite_and_Reference_EIS_Mappings[Composite and
Reference EIS Mappings]).

==== Mapped Records

The `+javax.resource.cci.MappedRecord+` represents a key-value map-based
collection of record elements based on the `+java.util.Map+` interface.

The EclipseLink runtime maps Java objects to mapped record elements or
subrecords of a mapped record depending on the type of EIS mapping you
use (see link:#Composite_and_Reference_EIS_Mappings[Composite and
Reference EIS Mappings]).

==== XML Records

An XML record represents a `+javax.resource.cci.Record+` as an XML
schema (XSD)-based XML document. Not all JCA adapters support XML
records.

The EclipseLink runtime maps Java objects to XML documents according to
your XSD and the behavior defined for XML mappings.

For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20XML%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Introduction to XML
Mappings].

=== XPath Support

When using XML records, EclipseLink EIS mappings use XPath statements to
efficiently map the attributes of a Java object to locations in an XML
record. For more information about using XPath with XML mappings, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Mappings_and_XPath[Mappings
and XPath].

=== xsd:list and xsd:union Support

When using XML records, you can use EIS direct (see
link:#EIS_Direct_Mapping[EIS Direct Mapping]) and composite direct
collection (see link:#EIS_Composite_Direct_Collection_Mapping[EIS
Composite Direct Collection Mapping]) mappings to map to `+xsd:list+`
and `+xsd:union+` types in an XML record.

For more information, see
Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Mappings_and_xsd:list_and_xsd:union_Types[Mappings
and xsd:list and xsd:union Types].

=== jaxb:class Support

When using XML records, you can configure an EIS composite object
mapping (see link:#EIS_Composite_Object_Mapping[EIS Composite Object
Mapping]) to accommodate `+jaxb:class+` customizations with the
following XSD structures:

* `+all+`
* `+sequence+`
* `+choice+`
* `+group+`

For more information, see
Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Mappings_and_the_jaxb:class_Customization[Mappings
and the jaxb:class Customization].

=== Typesafe Enumeration Support

You can map a Java attribute to a `+typesafe+` enumeration using the
`+JAXBTypesafeEnumConverter+` with an `+EISDirectMapping+` or
`+EISCompositeDirectCollectionMapping+` with XML records.

For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Mappings_and_JAXB_Typesafe_Enumerations[Mappings
and JAXB Typesafe Enumerations].

=== Composite and Reference EIS Mappings

EclipseLink supports composite and reference EIS mappings. Although
there is a source and target object in both mapping types, the
EclipseLink runtime handles interactions with each differently. This
section explains how.

==== Composite EIS Mappings

In a composite EIS mapping (
link:#EIS_Composite_Direct_Collection_Mapping[EIS Composite Direct
Collection Mapping], link:#EIS_Composite_Object_Mapping[EIS Composite
Object Mapping], and link:#EIS_Composite_Collection_Mapping[EIS
Composite Collection Mapping]), the source object contains (owns) the
target object.

EclipseLink puts the attributes of the target (owned) object (or the
owned collection of objects) into the source (owning) object’s record as
a subrecord. The target object needs not be a root object type (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_EIS_Descriptor_as_a_Root_or_Composite_Type[Configuring
an EIS Descriptor as a Root or Composite Type]): it needs not have
interactions defined for it.

The link:#Figure_73-1[EIS Composite Mappings] figure illustrates a read
interaction on an instance of the `+Customer+` class using indexed
records. For the composite object EIS mapping defined for the
`+address+` attribute, EclipseLink creates an `+Address+` subrecord in
the `+Customer+` record.

[#Figure 73-1]## *_EIS Composite Mappings_*

.EIS Composite Mappings
image::eiscomp.gif[EIS Composite
Mappings,title="EIS Composite Mappings"]

==== Reference EIS Mappings

In a reference EIS mapping ( link:#EIS_One-to-One_Mapping[EIS One-to-One
Mapping] and link:#EIS_One-to-Many_Mapping[EIS One-to-Many Mapping]),
the source object contains only a foreign key (pointer) to the target
object or, alternatively, the target object contains a foreign key to
the source object (key on target).

EclipseLink puts the foreign key of the target object into the source
object’s record as a simple value. When an interaction is executed on
the source object, EclipseLink uses the selection interaction that you
define on its descriptor to retrieve the appropriate target object
instance and creates a record for it in the source object’s transaction.
By default, the selection interaction is the target object’s read
interaction. If the read interaction is not sufficient, you can define a
separate selection interaction (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Selection_Interaction[Configuring
Selection Interaction]). Because both the source and target object use
interactions, they must both be of a root object type (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_EIS_Descriptor_as_a_Root_or_Composite_Type[Configuring
an EIS Descriptor as a Root or Composite Type]).

The link:#Figure_73-2[EIS Reference Mappings] figure illustrates a read
interaction on an instance of the `+Order+` class using indexed records.
For the one-to-one EIS mapping defined for the `+customer+` attribute,
EclipseLink puts the target `+Customer+` object’s foreign key into the
`+Order+` record as a simple value. EclipseLink then uses the selection
interaction you configure on the `+Order+` descriptor to retrieve the
appropriate instance of `+Customer+` and creates a record for it in the
`+Order+` object’s transaction.

image::eisref.gif[EIS Reference Mappings,title="EIS Reference Mappings"]

=== EIS Mapping Architecture

The link:#Figure_73-3[Possible EIS Mapping Architectures] figure
illustrates the following possible EclipseLink EIS mapping
architectures:

* JDBC database gateway (such as Oracle Database 10__g__)
* JDBC adapter
* Proprietary adapter (such as Oracle Interconnect)
* JCA

[#Figure 73-3]## *_Possible EIS Mapping Architectures_*

The best solution may vary, depending on your specific EIS and
infrastructure.

== EIS Direct Mapping

An EIS direct mapping maps a simple object attribute directly to an EIS
record according to its descriptor’s record type, as shown in this
table.

direct collection mapping between `+Order+` class attribute `+items+`
and an XML record. The `+Order+` attribute `+items+` is a collection
type (such as `+Vector+`). It is mapped to an XML record composed of an
`+order+` element that contains a sequence of `+item+` elements.

one-to-one relationship in an EIS record according to its descriptor’s
record type, as shown in this table.

`+Order+` class attribute `+address+` and an XML record. `+Order+`
attribute `+address+` is mapped to an XML record composed of an
`+order+` element that contains an `+address+` element.

== EIS Composite Collection Mapping

An EIS composite collection mapping maps a collection of Java objects to
a privately owned one-to-many relationship in an EIS record according to
its descriptor’s record type, as shown in the following table. Composite
collection mappings can reference any class that has an EclipseLink
descriptor.

collection EIS mapping between `+Phone+` class attribute
`+phoneNumbers+` and an XML record. `+Employee+` attribute
`+phoneNumbers+` is mapped to an XML record composed of an `+EMPLOYEE+`
element that contains a sequence of `+PHONE_NUMBER+` elements.

link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Composite%20Collection%20Mapping_(ELUG)[Configuring
an EIS Composite Collection Mapping] for more information.

== EIS One-to-One Mapping

An EIS one-to-one mapping is a reference mapping that represents the
relationship between a single source and target object. The source
object usually contains a foreign key (pointer) to the target object
(key on source). Alternatively, the target object may contain a foreign
key to the source object (key on target). Because both the source and
target object use interactions, they must both be of a root object type
(see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_EIS_Descriptor_as_a_Root_or_Composite_Type[Configuring
an EIS Descriptor as a Root or Composite Type])

This table summarizes the behavior of this mapping depending on the EIS
record type you are using.

[#Table 73-6]## *_EIS One-to-One Mapping by EIS Record Type_*

EIS Record Type

Mapping Behavior

Indexed

A new indexed record is created for the target object1:

=== EIS One-to-One Mappings with Key on Source

This figure illustrates a EIS one-to-one mapping between the
`+Employee+` class attribute `+project+` and the `+Project+` class using
XML records in a *key on source* design.

[#Figure 73-8]## *_EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on Source_*

.EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on Source
image::eisoto.gif[EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on
Source,title="EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on Source"]

When a read interaction is executed on the `+Employee+` object,
EclipseLink puts the target `+Project+` object’s primary key into the
`+Employee+` record as a simple value. EclipseLink then uses the
selection interaction you configure on the `+Employee+` descriptor to
retrieve the appropriate instance of `+Project+` and creates a record
for it in the `+Employee+` object’s transaction. In this example, you
can designate the `+Project+` class’s read interaction as the selection
interaction.

The general procedure for creating and configuring this mapping is as
follows:

[arabic]
. Create a one-to-one EIS mapping on `+Employee+` attribute `+project+`.
. Configure the reference descriptor as `+Project+` (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Reference_Descriptors[Configuring
Reference Descriptors]).
. Configure the source and target foreign keys (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20One-to-One%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Foreign_Key_Pairs[Configuring
Foreign Key Pairs]).In this example:
* Source XML Field: `+@project-id+`
* Target XML Field: `+@id+`
. Configure the selection interaction (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Selection_Interaction[Configuring
Selection Interaction]).In this example, you can designate the
`+Project+` class’s read interaction as the selection interaction.

Given the XSD shown in the link:#Example_73-1[XML Schema for EIS
One-to-One Mapping with Key on Source] example, you can configure an EIS
one-to-one mapping with key on source, as the link:#Example_73-2[EIS
One-to-One Mapping with Key On Source] example shows. In this case, the
source object contains a foreign key reference to the target object. In
the following example, the source object is `+Employee+` and the target
object is `+Project+`. Here, the `+Employee+` object has a `+Project+`
that is referenced using the project’s id.

=== EIS One-to-One Mappings with Key on Target

The link:#Figure_73-9[EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on Target] figure
illustrates EIS one-to-one mapping between the `+Employee+` class
attribute `+project+` and the `+Project+` class using XML records in a
*key on target* design. You still configure a one-to-one EIS mapping
between `+Employee+` and `+Project+`, but in this design, the
`+Project+` attribute `+leader+` contains the foreign key of the
`+Employee+` object.

[#Figure 73-9]## *_EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on Target_*

.EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on Target
image::eisotok.gif[EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on
Target,title="EIS One-to-One Mapping with Key on Target"]

When a read interaction is executed on the `+Employee+` object,
EclipseLink uses the selection interaction you configure on the
`+Employee+` descriptor to retrieve the appropriate instance of
`+Project+` and creates a record for it in the `+Employee+` object’s
transaction. In this example, the `+Project+` class’s read interaction
is unlikely to be sufficient: it is likely implemented to read based on
`+Project+` attribute `+Id+`, not on `+leader+`. If this is the case,
you must define a separate selection interaction on the `+Employee+`
descriptor that does the following: finds the `+Project+`, whose
`+leader+` equals X, where X is the value of `+Employee+` attribute
`+firstName+`.

Note that in this configuration, `+Project+` attribute `+leader+` is not
persisted. If you want this attribute persisted, you must configure a
one-to-one EIS mapping from it to `+Employee+` attribute `+firstName+`.

The general procedure for creating and configuring this mapping is as
follows:

[arabic]
. Create a one-to-one EIS mapping on `+Employee+` attribute `+project+`.
. Configure the reference descriptor as `+Project+` (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Reference_Descriptors[Configuring
Reference Descriptors]).
. Configure the source and target foreign keys (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20One-to-One%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Foreign_Key_Pairs[Configuring
Foreign Key Pairs]). In this example:
* Source XML Field: `+firstName/text()+`
* Target XML Field: `+leader/text()+`
. Configure the selection interaction (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Selection_Interaction[Configuring
Selection Interaction]). In this example, you must define a separate
selection interaction on the `+Employee+` descriptor.

Given the XSD shown in the link:#Example_73-3[XML Schema for EIS
One-to-One Mapping with Key on Target] example, you can configure an EIS
one-to-one mapping with key on target, as the link:#Example_73-4[EIS
One-to-One Mapping with Key on Target] example shows. In this case, the
target object contains a foreign key reference to the source object. In
the following example, the source object is `+Employee+`, and the target
object is `+Project+`. Here, a `+Project+` references its `+leader+`
using the employee’s name.

== EIS One-to-Many Mapping

An EIS one-to-many mapping is a reference mapping that represents the
relationship between a single source object and a collection of target
objects. The source object usually contains a foreign key (pointer) to
the target objects (key on source); alternatively, the target objects
may contain a foreign key to the source object (key on target). Because
both the source and target objects use interactions, they must all be of
a root object type (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_EIS_Descriptor_as_a_Root_or_Composite_Type[Configuring
an EIS Descriptor as a Root or Composite Type]).

This table summarizes the behavior of this mapping depending on the EIS
record type you are using.

[#Table 73-7]## *_EIS One-to-Many Mapping by EIS Record Type_*

EIS Record Type

Mapping Behavior

Indexed

A new indexed record is created for each target object1:

=== EIS One-to-Many Mappings with Key on Source

This figure illustrates an EIS one-to-many mapping between the
`+Employee+` class attribute `+projects+` and multiple `+Project+` class
instances using XML records in a key on source design.

[#'Figure 73-10]## *_EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Source_*

.EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Source
image::eisotm.gif[EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on
Source,title="EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Source"]

When a read interaction is executed on the `+Employee+` object,
EclipseLink puts each target `+Project+` object’s foreign key into the
`+Employee+` record as a subelement. If you specify only one pair of
source and target XML fields, by default, the foreign keys are not
grouped in the `+Employee+` record. If you specify more than one pair of
source and target XML fields, you must choose a grouping element (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Reference_Descriptors[Configuring
Reference Descriptors]). The link:#Figure_73-10[EIS One-to-Many Mapping
with Key on Source] figure shows an `+Employee+` record with grouping
element `+Project+`. EclipseLink then uses the selection interaction you
configure on the `+Employee+` descriptor to retrieve the appropriate
instances of `+Project+` and creates a record for each in the
`+Employee+` object’s transaction. In this example, you can designate
the `+Project+` class’s read interaction as the selection interaction.

The general procedure for creating and configuring this mapping is as
follows:

[arabic]
. Create a one-to-many EIS mapping on `+Employee+` attribute
`+project+`.
. Configure the reference descriptor as `+Project+` (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Reference_Descriptors[Configuring
Reference Descriptors]).
. Configure the source and target foreign keys (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20One-to-Many%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Foreign_Key_Pairs[Configuring
Foreign Key Pairs]). In this example:
* Source XML Field: `+PROJECT+`
* Target XML Field: `+@ID+`
. Configure the selection interaction (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Selection_Interaction[Configuring
Selection Interaction]). In this example, you can designate the
`+Project+` class’s read interaction as the selection interaction.

Given the XSD shown in link:#Example_73-3[XML Schema for EIS One-to-One
Mapping with Key on Target], you can configure an EIS one-to-many
mapping with key on source, as the link:#Example_73-4[EIS One-to-One
Mapping with Key on Target] example shows. In this case, the source
object contains a foreign key reference to the target object. In the
following example, the source object is `+Employee+`, and the target
object is `+Project+`. Here, the `+Employee+` object has one or more
`+Project+` instances that are referenced by `+Project+` id.

=== EIS One-to-Many Mappings with Key on Target

The link:#Figure_73-9[EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Target] figure
illustrates an EIS one-to-many mapping between the `+Employee+` class
attribute `+projects+` and multiple `+Project+` class instances using
XML records in a key on target design. You still configure a one-to-one
EIS mapping between `+Employee+` and `+Project+` but in this design, the
`+Project+` attribute `+leader+` contains the foreign key of the
`+Employee+` object.

[#'Figure 73-11]## *_EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Target_*

.EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Target
image::eisotmk.gif[EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on
Target,title="EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Target"]

When a read interaction is executed on the `+Employee+` object,
EclipseLink uses the selection interaction you configure on the
`+Employee+` descriptor to retrieve the appropriate instances of
`+Project+` and creates a record for each in the `+Employee+` object’s
transaction. In this example, the `+Project+` class’s read interaction
is unlikely to be sufficient: it is likely implemented to read based on
`+Project+` attribute `+Id+`, not on `+leader+`. If this is the case,
you must define a separate selection interaction on the `+Employee+`
descriptor that does the following: finds the `+Project+`, whose
`+leader+` equals X, where X is "`Jane`".

Note that in this configuration, `+Project+` attribute `+leader+` is not
persisted. If you want this attribute persisted, you must configure a
one-to-one EIS mapping from it to `+Employee+` attribute `+firstName+`.

The general procedure for creating and configuring this mapping is as
follows:

[arabic]
. Create a one-to-one EIS mapping on `+Employee+` attribute `+project+`.
. Configure the reference descriptor as `+Project+` (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Reference_Descriptors[Configuring
Reference Descriptors]).
. Configure the source and target foreign keys (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20One-to-One%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Foreign_Key_Pairs[Configuring
Foreign Key Pairs]). In this example, you select *Foreign Keys Located
On Source* and specify one pair of source and target XML fields:
* Source XML Field:
* Target XML Field:
. Configure the selection interaction (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Selection_Interaction[Configuring
Selection Interaction]). In this example, you must define a separate
selection interaction on the `+Employee+` descriptor.

Given the XSD shown in the link:#Example_73-3[XML Schema for EIS
One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Target] example, you can configure an
EIS one-to-many mapping with key on target, as the
link:#Example_73-4[EIS One-to-Many Mapping with Key on Target] example
shows. In this case, the target object contains a foreign key reference
to the source object. In the following example, the source object is
`+Employee+`, and the target object is `+Project+`. Here, each
`+Project+` references its `+leader+` using the employee’s name.

== EIS Transformation Mapping

A transformation EIS mapping lets you create a custom mapping, where one
or more fields in an EIS record can be used to create the object to be
stored in a Java class’s attribute.

This table summarizes the behavior of this mapping depending on the EIS
record type you are using.

[#Table 73-8 EIS]## *_Transformation Mapping by EIS Record Type_*

[width="100%",cols="<15%,<85%",options="header",]
|===
|*EIS Record Type* |*Mapping Behavior*
|Indexed |The field transformer adds data to the indexed record (you
have access to the indexed record in the attribute transformer).

|Mapped |The field transformer adds data to the mapped record (you have
access to the mapped record in the attribute transformer).

|XML |The field transformer adds data to the XML record (you have access
to the XML record in the attribute transformer).
|===

As the link:#Figure_73-12[EIS Transformation Mappings] figure
illustrates, you configure the transformation mapping with an
`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.transformers.AttributeTransformer+`
instance to perform the XML instance-to-Java attribute transformation at
unmarshall time. In this example, the `+AttributeTransformer+` combines
two XML text nodes into a single Java object.
