An object-relational data type mapping taransforms certain object data
member types to structured data source representations optimized for
storage in specialized object-relational data type databases (such as
Oracle Database). Object-relational data type mappings let you map an
object model into an object-relational data type data model.

Consider the following sections:

* link:Introduction_to_Object-Relational_Data_Type_Mappings_(ELUG)[Introduction
to Object-Relational Data Type Mappings] – describes each of the
different EclipseLink object-relational data type mapping types and
important object-relational data type mapping concepts.

* link:Configuring_an_Object-Relational_Data_Type_Mapping_(ELUG)[Configuring
an Object-Relational Data Type Mapping] – explains how to configure
EclipseLink object-relational data type mapping options common to two or
more object-relational data type mapping types.
