== Introduction to the EclipseLink Deployment File Creation

Depending on the type of application you are deploying, you may need to
create any of the following deployment files:

* link:#project.xml_File[project.xml File]
* link:#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml File]

Workbench provides the ability to
link:Creating%20a%20Project%20(ELUG)#Exporting_Project_Information[create
deployment files from a Workbench project] "`wikilink`"). After you
build a project, you have two options to create the deployment files:

* Create XML deployment files that require no compiling.
* Create Java source files, which you compile and deploy outside of
Workbench.

We recommend XML deployment because XML files are easier to deploy and
troubleshoot than compiled Java files. This approach gives you a very
flexible configuration that enables you to make changes safely and
easily. XML deployment files do not require third-party applications or
compilers to deploy successfully.

|===
|*Note:* If you are using JPA, you can use annotations to specify most
of what you formerly specified in deployment descriptors. Use deployment
descriptors to override annotations or specify options not supported by
annotations.
|===

=== project.xml File

The `+project.xml+` file is the core of your application. It contains
the descriptors and mappings you define and also includes any named
queries or finders associated with your project.

==== XSD File Format

The `+project.xml+` file XSD is `+persistence_1_0.xsd+` and it is
located in the __`+\xsds+` directory.

See link:EclipseLink_XSDs[EclipseLink/XSDs] for more information.

==== POJO Applications and Project Metadata

For a POJO application, you define your project metadata in a
`+project.xml+` file.

The `+project.xml+` file provides a simple and flexible way to
configure, modify, and troubleshoot the project metadata. Because of
these attributes, the `+project.xml+` file is the preferred way to
configure an EclipseLink project.Workbench provides a graphical tool to
build and edit the `+project.xml+` file. For information on creating
projects with Workbench, see
link:#Creating_the_project.xml_File_with_Workbench[Creating the
project.xml File with Workbench].

==== JPA Applications and Project Metadata

For a JPA application, you can express project metadata using JPA
annotations, `+persistence.xml+`, `+orm.xml+`, and EclipseLink JPA
annotation and `+persistence.xml+` property extensions. The EclipseLink
JPA persistence provider interprets all these sources of metadata to
create an in-memory EclipseLink session and project at run time.

Using EclipseLink JPA, you also have the option of specifying your
metadata using EclipseLink `+sessions.xml+` and `+project.xml+` while
accessing your persistent classes using JPA and an `+EntityManager+`.
For more information, see
link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_EclipseLink_JPA_Overriding_Mechanisms[What
You May Need to Know About EclipseLink JPA Overriding Mechanisms].

==== Creating the project.xml File with Workbench

Because you must synchronize the `+project.xml+` file with the classes
and data source associated with your application, we recommend that you
not modify this file manually. Workbench ensures proper synchronization,
and is the best way to make changes to the project. Simply modify the
project in Workbench and redeploy the `+project.xml+` file. Using this
option reduces development time by eliminating the need to regenerate
and recompile Java code each time the project changes.

See
link:Creating%20a%20Project%20(ELUG)#Exporting_Project_Information[Exporting
Project Information] for detailed information on exporting the
deployment XML information.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: You can name this file with a name other than `+project.xml+`;
however, for clarity, this discussion assumes that the file has not been
renamed.
|===

==== Creating project.xml Programatically

Optionally, you can use the `+DeploymentXMLGenerator+` API to
programatically generate the `+project.xml+` file in either of the
following ways:

* From an application, instantiate the `+DeploymentXMLGenerator+` and
your java source. Call the following
method:`+generate (+`_`+<MW_Project.mwp>+`_`+,+`
_`+<output file.xml>+`_`+)+`
* From the command line, use the following:

`+java -classpath eclipselink.jar;eclispelinkmw.jar;+`
`+org.eclipse.persistence.tools.workbench.mappings.DeploymentXMLGenerator +`_`+<MW_Project.mwp>+`_`+ +`_`+<output\'\' \'\'file.xml>+`_

Before you use either method, ensure that your classpath includes the
__`+\jlib\eclipselink.jar+` and
__`+\utils\workbench\jlib\eclipselinkmw.jar+` files.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* If you are using EJB 3.0, you can use annotations to specify
most of what you formerly specified in the `+project.xml+` file. To
override annotations or specify options not supported by annotations,
you can still provide a `+project.xml+` file in your EJB 3.0
application.
|===

=== sessions.xml File

Each EclipseLink project belongs to an EclipseLink _session_. A session
is the facade through which an application accesses EclipseLink
functionality (for more information on sessions, see
link:EclipseLink_UserGuide_Using_EclipseLink_Sessions_(ELUG)[EclipseLink
Sessions]).

==== XSD File Format

The `+sessions.xml+` file XSD is
`+eclipse_persistence_sessions_1_0.xsd+` and it is located in the
__`+\xsds+` directory as well as on the web at
http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/xsds/eclipse_persistence_sessions_1_0.xsd.

When you use the XSD formatted `+sessions.xml+` file, the EclipseLink
run time separates `+sessions.xml+` file validation from session
instantiation. Separating XML file formatting problems from Session
Manager session instantiation problems simplifies troubleshooting.
Exceptions thrown during validation clearly indicate that the failure is
due to an invalid `+sessions.xml+` file, as the following illustrates.

[#Example 8-1]## *_Enhanced Validation Exceptions_*

`+Exception [ECLIPSELINK-9010] (EclipseLink): org.eclipselink.exceptions.SessionLoaderException+`
`+Exception Description: A End tag does not match start tag 'session'. was thrown while parsing the XML file against the XML schema.+`
`+Internal Exception: oracle.xml.parser.v2.XMLParseException: End tag does not match start tag 'session'.+`

==== POJO Applications and Session Metadata

For a POJO application, you define your sessions in a `+sessions.xml+`
file.

The `+sessions.xml+` file provides a simple and flexible way to
configure, modify, and troubleshoot the application sessions. Because of
these attributes, the `+sessions.xml+` file is the preferred way to
configure an EclipseLink session.EclipseLink provides graphical toosl to
build and edit the `+sessions.xml+` file. For information see
link:Creating%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)[Creating a Session].

==== JPA Applications and Session Metadata

For a JPA application, you can express session metadata using JPA
annotations, `+persistence.xml+`, `+orm.xml+`, and EclipseLink JPA
annotation and `+persistence.xml+` property extensions. The EclipseLink
JPA persistence provider interprets all these sources of metadata to
create an in-memory EclipseLink session and project at run time.

Using EclipseLink JPA, you also have the option of specifying your
metadata using EclipseLink `+sessions.xml+` and `+project.xml+` while
accessing your persistent classes using JPA and an `+EntityManager+`.
For more information, see
link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_EclipseLink_JPA_Overriding_Mechanisms[What
You May Need to Know About EclipseLink JPA Overriding Mechanisms].

== Creating Deployment Files for Java Applications

In a Java application, EclipseLink does not use a Java EE container for
deployment. Instead, it relies on EclipseLink mechanisms to provide
functionality and persistence. The key elements of this type of
application are the lack of a Java EE container and the fact that you
deploy the application by placing the application JAR file on the
classpath.

Java applications require the following deployment files:

* link:#project.xml_File[project.xml File]
* link:#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml File]

== Creating Deployment Files for JavaServer Pages and Servlet Applications

Many designers build EclipseLink applications that use JavaServer Pages
(JSP) and Java servlets. This type of design generally supports
Web-based applications.

JSP and servlet applications require the following deployment files:

* link:#project.xml_File[project.xml File]
* link:#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml File]

== Creating Deployment Files for Session Bean Applications

Session beans generally model a process, operation, or service and as
such, are not persistent. You can build EclipseLink applications that
wrap interaction with EclipseLink in session beans. Session beans
execute all EclipseLink-related operations on behalf of the client.

This type of design uses JTS and externally managed transactions, but
does not incur the overhead associated with persistence applications.
Session bean applications also scale and deploy easily.

This section describes the following:

* link:#How_to_Create_Deployment_Files_for_EJB_3.0_Session_Bean_Applications[How
to Create Deployment Files for EJB 3.0 Session Bean Applications]

=== How to Create Deployment Files for EJB 3.0 Session Bean Applications

We recommend using JPA annotations and persistence unit properties, or a
special-case `+eclipselink.sessions-xml+` persistence unit property (see
link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)#EclipseLink_JPA_Persistence_Unit_Properties_for_Database,_Session,_and_Application_Server[EclipseLink
JPA Persistence Unit Properties for Database&#44; Session&#44; and
Application Server]) in your EJB 3.0 session bean application.

You may also choose to use the link:#project.xml_File[project.xml File]
and link:#sessions.xml_File[sessions.xml File].

For more information, see the following:

* link:Introduction_to_Java_Persistence_API_(ELUG)#Java_Persistence_API_Overview[Java
Persistence API Overview]
* link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_JPA_(ELUG)#EclipseLink_JPA_Overview[EclipseLink
JPA Overview]
* link:Developing_Applications_Using_EclipseLink_JPA_(ELUG)#Application_Development_with_EclipseLink_JPA[Application
Development with EclipseLink JPA)]

== Creating Deployment Files for JPA Applications

See
link:Packaging_and_Deploying_EclipseLink_JPA_Applications_(ELUG)[Packaging
and Deploying EclipseLink JPA Applications] for information on how to
create deployment files for your JPA application.

== Configuring the weblogic-ejb-jar.xml File for WebLogic Server

Before you deploy a EclipseLink application to Oracle WebLogic Server,
you must modify the `+weblogic-ejb-jar.xml+` file.

Avoid the `+weblogic-ejb-jar.xml+` tags that EclipseLink either does not
support or does not require (see
link:#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_Unsupported_weblogic-ejb-jar.xml_File_Tags[What
You May Need to Know About Unsupported weblogic-ejb-jar.xml File Tags]).

=== What You May Need to Know About Unsupported weblogic-ejb-jar.xml File Tags

The `+weblogic-ejb-jar.xml+` file includes the following tags that
EclipseLink either does not support or does not require:

* `+concurrency-strategy+`: This tag specifies how Oracle WebLogic
Server manages concurrent users for a given bean. Because EclipseLink
manages concurrent access internally, it does not require this tag. For
more information about the EclipseLink concurrency strategy, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Locking_Policy[Configuring
Locking Policy].
* `+db-is-shared+`: Because EclipseLink does not make any assumptions
about the exclusivity of database access, EclipseLink does not require
this tag. EclipseLink addresses multiuser access issues through various
locking and refreshing policies.
* `+delay-updates-until-end-of-tx+`: EclipseLink always delays updates
until the end of a transaction, and does not require this tag.
* `+finders-load-bean+`: EclipseLink always loads the bean upon
execution of the finder, and does not require this tag.
* `+pool+`: EclipseLink does not use a pooling strategy for entity
beans. This avoids object-identity problems that can occur due to
pooling.
* `+lifecycle+`: This element manages beans that follow a pooling
strategy. Because EclipseLink does not use a pooling strategy,
EclipseLink ignores this tag.
* `+is-modified-method-name+`: EclipseLink does not require a bean
developer-defined method to detect changes in the object state.
* `+isolation-level+`: Because isolation level settings for the cache or
database transactions are specified in the EclipseLink project,
EclipseLink ignores this tag.
* `+cache+`: Because you define EclipseLink cache properties in
Workbench, this tag is unnecessary.
