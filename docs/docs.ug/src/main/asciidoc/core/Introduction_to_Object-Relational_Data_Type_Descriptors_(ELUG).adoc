This section provides an overview of object-relational data type
descriptors.

For information on descriptor concepts and features common to more than
one type of EclipseLink descriptors, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)[Introduction to
Descriptors].

The object-relational data type paradigm extends traditional relational
databases to include object-oriented functions. Oracle, IBM DB2,
Informix, and other DBMS databases allow users to store, access, and use
complex data in more sophisticated ways.The object-relational data type
standard is an evolving standard concerned mainly with extending the
database data structures and SQL (SQL 3).

Object-relational data type descriptors describe Java objects that you
map to special relational database types that correspond more closely to
object types. Using these special object-relational data type database
types can simplify mapping objects to relational database tables. Not
all relational databases support these special object-relational data
type database types.

Using object-relational data type descriptors in a relational project,
you can configure object-relational data type mappings to these special
object-relational data type database data types (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Object-Relational%20Data%20Type%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Object-Relational_Data_Type_Mapping_Types[Object-Relational
Data Type Mapping Types]).
