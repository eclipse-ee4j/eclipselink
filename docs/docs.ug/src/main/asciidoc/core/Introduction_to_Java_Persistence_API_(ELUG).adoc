Topics]

This section introduces concepts of Java Persistence API and provides
general information on it.

== What Is Java Persistence API?

The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a lightweight framework for Java
persistence (see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink%20Application%20Development%20(ELUG)#Persisting_Objects[Persisting
Objects]) based on Plain Old Java Object (POJO). JPA is a part of EJB
3.0 and 3.1 specifications. JPA provides an object relational mapping
approach that lets you declaratively define how to map Java objects to
relational database tables in a standard, portable way. You can use this
API to create, remove and query across lightweight Java objects within
both an EJB 3.0/3.1-compliant container and a standard Java SE 5/6
environment.

specifications]

== What Do You Need to Develop with JPA

To start developing with JPA, you need the following:

* link:#Relational_Database[Relational Database]
* link:#Domain_Model_Classes[Domain Model Classes]
* link:#persistence.xml_File[persistence.xml File]
* link:#Object_Relational_Mapping_Metadata[Object Relational Mapping
Metadata]
* link:#Persistence_Provider[Persistence Provider]
* link:#Persistence_Application_Code[Persistence Application Code]

=== Relational Database

To develop your applications with JPA, you can use any relational
database.

=== Domain Model Classes

Your domain model should consist of classes representing
entities–lightweight persistent domain objects. The easiest way to
define an entity class is by using the `+@Entity+` annotation (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20(ELUG)#Using_Metadata_Annotations[Using
Metadata Annotations]), as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
 @Entity
 public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = -8865917134914502125L;
 ...
 }
----

For more information on entities, see the following:

* Section 2.1 "`Requirements on the Entity Class`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* Section 8.1 "`Entity`" of the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA
Specification]

JPA Entity Architecture]
* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_Entity[Configuring
an Entity]

=== persistence.xml File

Use the `+persistence.xml+` file to package your entities.

For more information and examples, see the following:

* Section 6.2.1 "`persistence.xml file`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* link:Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_(ELUG)#What_You_May_Need_to_Know_About_Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Persistence_Unit_Properties[What
You May Need to Know About Using EclipseLink JPA Persistence Unit
Properties]

=== Object Relational Mapping Metadata

Object relational mapping metadata specifies the mapping of your domain
model classes to the database.

You can express this metadata in the form of annotations and/or XML.

==== Metadata Annotations and ORM.xml File

A metadata annotation represents a Java language feature that lets you
attach structured and typed metadata to the source code. Annotations
alone are sufficient for the metadata specification–you do not need to
use XML. Annotations for object relational mapping are in the
`+javax.persistence+` package. For more information and examples, see
Chapter 8 "`Metadata Annotations`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]

An object relational mapping XML file is optional. If you choose to
provide one, then it should contain mapping information for the classes
listed in it. The persistence provider loads an `+orm.xml+` file (or
other mapping file) as a resource. If you provide a mapping file, the
classes and mapping information specified in the mapping file will be
used. For more information and examples, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20(ELUG)#Using_XML[Using
XML]
* Section 6.2.1.6 "`mapping-file, jar-file, class,
exclude-unlisted-classes`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]

==== Overriding Annotations with XML

XML mapping metadata may combine with and override annotation metadata.
For more information and examples, see the following:

* Section 10.1 "`XML Overriding Rules`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]
* link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)#Overriding_Annotations_with_XML[Overriding
Annotations with XML]

===== Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Annotations

Metadata annotations are relatively simple to use and understand. They
provide in-line metadata located with the code that this metadata is
describing–you do not need to replicate the source code context of where
the metadata applies.

On the other hand, annotations unnecessarily couple the metadata to the
code. Thus, changes to metadata require changing the source code.

===== Advantages and Disadvantages of Using XML

The following are advantages of using XML:

* no coupling between the metadata and the source code;
* compliance with the existing, pre-EJB 3.0 development process;
* support in IDEs and source control systems;

The main disadvantages of mapping with XML are the complexity and the
need for replication of the code context.

=== Persistence Provider

The persistence provider supplies the implementation of the JPA
specification.

The persistence provider handles the object relational mapping of the
relationships, including their loading and storing to the database (as
specified in the metadata of the entity class), and the referential
integrity of the relationships (as specified in the database).

For example, the EclipseLink persistence provider ensures that
relational descriptors are created for annotated objects, as well as
mappings are created based on annotations.

=== Persistence Application Code

To manage entities (see link:#Domain_Model_Classes[Domain Model
Classes]) in your persistence application, you need to obtain an entity
manager from an `+EntityManagerFactory+`. How you get the entity manager
and its factory largely depends on the Java environment in which you are
developing your application.

==== Container-Managed Entity Manager

In the Java EE environment, you acquire an entity manager by injecting
it using the `+@PersistenceContext+` annotation (dependency injection),
as the link:#Example_17-1[Obtaining an Entity Manager Through Dependency
Injection] example shows, or using a direct lookup of the entity manager
in the JNDI namespace, as the link:#Example_17-2[Performing JNDI Lookup
of an Entity Manager] example shows.

===== Example 17-1

[#'Example 17-1]## *_Obtaining an Entity Manager Through Dependency
Injection_*

[source,java]
----
 @PersistenceContext
 public EntityManager em;
----

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* You can only use the `+@PersistenceContext+` annotation
injection on session beans, servlets and JSP.
|===

===== Example 17-2

[#Example 17-2]## *_Performing JNDI Lookup of an Entity Manager_*

[source,java]
----
 @Stateless
 @PersistenceContext(name="ProjectEM", unitName="Project")
 public class ProjectSessionBean implements Project {
     @Resource
     SessionContext ctx;

     public void makeCurrent() {
         try {
            EntityManager em = (EntityManager)ctx.lookup("ProjectEM");
            ...
     }
 }
----

See the following
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/eclipselink-users/msg04632.html[EclipseLink
post] for concurrency issues when using an EntityManager directly on a
servlet outside of a function local variable instead of a Statelss
session bean.

The container would manage the life cycle of this entity manager–your
application does not have to create it or close it.

For more information and examples, see the following sections of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]:

* Section 3.1 "`EntityManager`"
* Section 5.2.1 "`Obtaining an Entity Manager in the Java EE
Environment`"
* Section 5.3.1 "`Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in a Java EE
Container`"

==== Application-Managed Entity Manager

In the Java SE environment, not the container but the application
manages the life cycle of an entity manager. You would create this
entity manager using the `+EntityManagerFactory+`’s method
`+createEntityManager+`. You have to use the
`+javax.persistence.Persistence+` class to bootstrap an
`+EntityManagerFactory+` instance, as this example shows:

[#Example 17-3]## *_Application-Managed Entity Manager in the Java SE
Environment_*

[source,java]
----
 public class Employee {

     public static void main(String[] args) {
         EntityManagerFactory emf =
             Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("EmpService");
         EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
     ...
         em.close();
         emf.close();
 }
----

Notice that you need to explicitly close the entity manager and the
factory.

In the Java EE environment, you can use the application-managed entity
managers as well. You would create it using the `+@PersistenceUnit+`
annotation to declare a reference to the `+EntityManagerFactory+` for a
persistence unit, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
 @PersistenceUnit
 EntityManagerFactory emf;
----

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* You can only use the `+@PersistenceContext+` annotation
injection on session beans, servlets and JSP.
|===

For more information and examples, see the following sections of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification]:

* Section 5.2.2 "`Obtaining an Application-managed Entity Manager`"
* Section 5.3.2 "`Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in a Java SE
Environment`"

==== Transaction Management

Transactions define when new, changed or removed entities are
synchronized to the database.

JPA supports the following two types of transaction management:

* link:#JTA_Transaction_Management[JTA Transaction Management]
* link:#Resource-Local_Transactions[Resource-Local Transactions]

Container-managed entity managers always use JTA transactions.
Application-managed entity managers may use JTA or resource-local
transactions. The default transaction type for Java EE application is
JTA.

You define the transaction type for a persistence unit and configure it
using the `+persistence.xml+` file (see
link:#persistence.xml_File[persistence.xml File]).

For more information, see Section 5.5 "`Controlling Transactions`" of
the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification].

===== JTA Transaction Management

JTA transactions are the transactions of the Java EE server.

As section 5.5.1 "`JTA Entity Managers`" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification] defines, "`An
entity manager whose transactions are controlled through JTA is a JTA
entity manager. A JTA entity manager participates in the current JTA
transaction, which is begun and committed external to the entity manager
and propagated to the underlying resource manager.`"

===== Resource-Local Transactions

Resource-local transactions are the native transactions of the JDBC
drivers that are referenced by a persistence unit. Your application
explicitly controls these transactions. Your application interacts with
the resource-local transactions by acquiring an implementation of the
`+EntityTransaction+` interface from the entity manager.

For more information and examples, see the following sections of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JPA Specification].

* Section 5.5.2 "`Resource-local Entity Managers`"
* Section 5.5.2.1 "`The EntityTransaction Interface`"
