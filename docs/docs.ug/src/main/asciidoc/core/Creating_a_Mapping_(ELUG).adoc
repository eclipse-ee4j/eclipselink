You can create a database mapping using the Workbench or Java code. We
recommend using the Workbench to create and manage your mappings.

For more information on creating mappings in Java, see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_JPA_(ELUG)[EclipseLink API Reference].

For complete information on the various types of mapping that
EclipseLink supports, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Mapping_Types[Mapping Types].

During development, you can create mappings individually (see
link:#Creating_Mappings_Manually_During_Development[Creating Mappings
Manually During Development]) or you can allow Workbench to
automatically map all attributes (see
link:#Creating_Mappings_Automatically_During_Development[Creating
Mappings Automatically During Development]).

For JPA projects, you can create mappings using JPA annotations (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20(ELUG)#Object_Relational_Mapping_with_EclipseLink_JPA[Object
Relational Mapping with EclipseLink JPA]). JPA lets you create mappings
automatically at run time.

After you create a mapping, you must configure its various options (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Mapping%20(ELUG)[Configuring a Mapping]).

== Creating Mappings Manually During Development

You can manually create a mapping from each persistent field of a class
to a data source using Workbench or Java code. We recommend that you use
Workbench.

=== How to Create Mappings Manually During Development Using Workbench

To manually create a mapping using Workbench, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select a descriptor in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear in the
Editor.
. On the *Descriptor Info* tab, associate the descriptor with its data
source:
[arabic]
.. For a relational project, in the *Editor*, select the table for this
descriptor from the *Associated Table* menu. The Workbench populates
this menu with tables from the database login you associated with your
project. For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Project%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Login_Information_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Login Information at the Project Level].
.. For an XML project, in the *Editor*, select the appropriate schema
context for this descriptor by clicking on the *Browse* button next to
the *Schema Context* field. The Workbench displays the schema context
from the XML schema you associated with your project. For more
information, see link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Using_XML_Schemas[Using
XML Schemas].
. In the *Navigator*, expand the descriptor to display its attributes.
. Select an attribute and do one of the following:
[arabic]
.. Click the appropriate mapping on the toolbar (see
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Using_Context_Toolbar[Using Context
Toolbar]).
.. Right-click the attribute and select *Map As >* to choose a specific
mapping type from the context menu (see
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Using_Context_Menus[Using Context
Menus]).

Continue with link:Configuring%20a%20Mapping%20(ELUG)[Configuring a
Mapping] to complete the mapping.

=== How to Create Mappings During Development Using Java

You create mappings using the constructor of the particular mapping
type, as the following examples show:

[#Example 116-1]## *_Creating Relational One-to-One Mapping_*

`+ org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.OneToOneMapping oom = new OneToOneMappiing();+`

[#Example 116-2]## *_Creating Relational Direct Collection Mapping_*

`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.DirectCollectionMapping dcm =new DirectCollectionMappiing();+`

[#Example 116-3]## *_Creating Object-Relational Data Type Structure
Mapping_*

`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.structures.StructureMapping sm = new StructureMappiing();+`

[#Example 116-4]## *_Creating Object-Relational Data Type Array
Mapping_*

`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.structures.ArrayMapping am = new ArrayMappiing();+`

== Creating Mappings Automatically During Development

For relational database projects, the Workbench can automatically map
class attributes to a similarly named database field. For example, these
tools can map the attribute `+province+` to the database field `+PROV+`,
the attribute `+street+` to the field `+ST+`, and the attribute
`+postalCode+` to the field `+POSTAL_CODE+`.

The Automap function creates mappings only for unmapped attributes–it
does not change previously defined mappings.

You can automatically map classes for an entire project or for specific
classes or descriptors.

|===
|*Note*: Associating a descriptor with a database table (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Associated_Tables[Configuring
Associated Tables]) before using the Automap function can aid the
automapper if it cannot guess the correct table for a class.
|===

=== How to Create Mappings Automatically During Development Using Workbench

To automatically map _all_ the descriptors in a project, right-click the
project icon in the *Navigator* window and choose *Automap* from the
context menu or choose *Selected* *>* *Automap* from the menu.

To automatically map a _specific_ descriptor or attribute, choose the
descriptor or attributes and right-click, and then select *Automap* from
the context menu or choose *Selected* *>* *Automap* from the menu.

== Creating Mappings to Oracle LOB Database Objects

In an Oracle Database, large amounts of binary or character data is
stored as a `+BLOB+` (binary large object) or `+CLOB+` (character large
object), respectively. Depending on the size of the `+LOB+` value and
your Oracle Database database version, the value may be stored either
inside or outside of the table, as follows:

* With Oracle8i version 8.1.6 and earlier, `+LOB+` values less than 4K
are stored inline; values more than 4K are stored outside the table.
* With Oracle8i version 8.1.7 and later, `+LOB+` values less than 5.9K
are stored inline; values more than 5.9K are stored outside the table.

A client application (such as EclipseLink) must use a LOB locator to
write a LOB value, if the value is stored outside of the database. The
Oracle JDBC OCI driver and server driver handle these LOB (large object)
values differently than the Oracle JDBC thin driver.

=== How to Create Mappings to Oracle LOB Database Objects Using the Oracle JDBC Thin Driver

When using the Oracle JDBC thin driver, EclipseLink is responsible for
acquiring the LOB locator before writing the value. You can use a type
conversion mapping (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Type_Conversion_Converter[Configuring
a Type Conversion Converter]) to retrieve the locator during a commit
operation.

Use this procedure to map `+LOB+` values using the Oracle JDBC thin
driver:

[arabic]
. Use a type conversion mapping to map the attributes of a EclipseLink
descriptor to a LOB value. The followiing figure shows a type conversion
mapping to a `+BLOB+` value in Workbench. The
link:#Example_116-11[Mapping a BLOB in Java Code] example shows the Java
code for the same mapping. [#Example 116-10]##*_Mapping a BLOB in
Workbench_* image:blob.gif[Mapping a BLOB in
Workbench,title="Mapping a BLOB in Workbench"] [#Example 116-11]## ***
Mapping a BLOB in Java Code***
+
`+TypeConversionMapping pictureMapping = new TypeConversionMapping();+`
`+pictureMapping.set.AttributeName("picture");+`
`+pictureMapping.setFieldName("IMAGE.PICTURE");+`
`+pictureMapping.setFieldClassification(java.sql.Blob.class);+`
`+descriptor.addMapping(pictureMapping);+`
. Acquire the `+DatabaseLogin+` from the session:
`+DatabaseLogin login = session.getLogin();+`
. Configure a platform that provides locator support, as follows:
* For Oracle8i, use the
`+org.eclipse.persistence.oraclespecific.Oracle8Platform+` class:
+
`+   login.usePlatform(new Oracle8Platform());+`
* For Oracle9__i__ Database Server, use the
`+org.eclipse.persistence.oraclespecific.Oracle9Platform+` class:
+
`+   login.usePlatform(new Oracle9Platform());+`
* Oracle Database 10__g__, use the
`+org.eclipse.persistence.oraclespecific.Oracle10Platform+` class:
+
`+   login.usePlatform(new Oracle10Platform());+`
+
In Workbench, select the appropriate platform in the Database
editor.[#Figure 116-1]## *_Selecting Database Platform in Workbench_*

Workbench,title="Selecting Database Platform in Workbench"]

== Removing Mappings

If you are using the Workbench, you can unmap any mapped attribute.

=== How to Remove Mappings Using Workbench

To unmap an attribute (that is, remove its mapping), use this procedure:

image:unmapbtn.gif[Unmap button,title="Unmap button"] Select the
attribute in the *Navigator* window and click *Unmap*. You can also
unmap the attribute by right-clicking the attribute and selecting *Map
As > Unmapped* from the context menu.

To unmap all the attributes in a descriptor or Java package, use this
procedure:

image:unmapbtn.gif[Unmap all Descriptors
button,title="Unmap all Descriptors button"] Right-click the descriptor
or Java package in the *Navigator* window and select *Unmap > Unmap
Selected Descriptor* or *Unmap All Descriptors in Package* from the
context menu.

=== How to Remove Mappings Using Java

Use the `+ClassDescriptor+` method `+removeMappingForAttributeName+` to
unmap an attribute.
