For information on configuring a historical session using an Oracle
Database platform, see

to Configure Historical Sessions Using an Oracle Platform].

For information on configuring a historical session using any supported
database platform and a EclipseLink `+HistoryPolicy+`, see
link:#How_to_Configure_Historical_Sessions_Using_a_EclipseLink_HistoryPolicy[How
to Configure Historical Sessions Using a EclipseLink HistoryPolicy].

For more information about historical sessions, see

Sessions].

== Introduction to Historical Session Configuration

There are two following ways to configure EclipseLink to access the
historical versions of objects maintained by your data source:

* using an Oracle platform (see
link:#How_to_Configure_Historical_Sessions_Using_an_Oracle_Platform[How
to Configure Historical Sessions Using an Oracle Platform])
* using EclipseLink `+HistoryPolicy+` (see
link:#How_to_Configure_Historical_Sessions_Using_a_EclipseLink_HistoryPolicy[How
to Configure Historical Sessions Using a EclipseLink HistoryPolicy])

=== How to Configure Historical Sessions Using an Oracle Platform

Oracle9__i__ Database Server (or later) automatically maintains
historical versions of objects and extends SQL with an `+AS_OF+` clause
used to query this historical data. Oracle refers to these as flashback
queries.

If you configure your `+Session+` with an `+OraclePlatform+` (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)[Configuring a
Relational Database Platform at the Session Level]) for Oracle9__i__
Database Server (or later), you can query the historical versions of
objects automatically maintained by Oracle Database.

No further session configuration is required.

For more information, see the following:

a Historical Session]
* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Queries%20(ELUG)#Historical_Queries[Historical
Queries].

=== How to Configure Historical Sessions Using a EclipseLink HistoryPolicy

If you use a schema that you designed to maintain historical versions of
objects and if that schema can be described by EclipseLink
`+HistoryPolicy+`, you can query the historical versions of objects
maintained by your database in accordance with your schema.

a History Policy]
