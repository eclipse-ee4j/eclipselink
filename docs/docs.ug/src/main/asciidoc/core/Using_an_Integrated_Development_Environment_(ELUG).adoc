Topics]

In addition to the development environment described in this section,
you can use EclipseLink with _any_ Java EE development environment and
process.

== Configuring Workbench with Source Control Management Software

You can use Workbench with a source control management (SCM) system to
facilitate enterprise-level team development (see
link:#How_to_Use_a_Source_Control_Management_System[How to Use a Source
Control Management System]). If you have a small development team, you
can manage the changes from within XML files (see
link:#How_to_Share_Project_Objects[How to Share Project Objects]).

When using a Workbench project in a team environment, you must
synchronize your changes with other developers. See
link:#How_to_Merge_Files[How to Merge Files] for more information.

=== How to Use a Source Control Management System

If you use an enterprise, file-based source control management system to
manage your Java source files, you can use the same system with your
Workbench project files. These project files are maintained by Workbench
and written out in XML file format.

The _check in_ and _check out_ mechanism for the source control system
defines how to manage the source (the XML source and Workbench project
file) in a multiuser environment.

*Checking Out and Checking In Workbench Project Files*

Although your actual development process will vary depending on your SCM
tool, a typical process involves the following steps:

[arabic]
. Determine (based on your SCM system) which files to retrieve from the
source management system.
. Edit the project using Workbench.
. Save the edited project. If Workbench displays the Read-Only Files
dialog box, make a note of these files, they must be unlocked and
possibly merged. See link:#How_to_Work_with_Locked_Files[How to Work
with Locked Files] for more information.
. Merge the required project files. See link:#How_to_Merge_Files[How to
Merge Files] for details.
. Check in the modified files, then retrieve from the repository any
files that have been added or modified for this Workbench project.

=== How to Merge Files

The most difficult aspect of application development is merging changes
from two (or more) development team members that have simultaneously
edited the same file. If you check in your changes, a _merge_ condition
exists. Use a file comparison tool to determine the merged aspects of
the project. The files to edit will vary, depending on the type of
merge, as follows:

* link:#Project_Files[Project Files]
* link:#Merging_Table,_Descriptor,_and_Class_Files[Merging Table&#44;
Descriptor&#44; and Class Files]

link:#example_merging_projects[Merging Projects] and
link:#example_merging_files[Merging Files] examples demonstrate a _merge
out_ merging technique.

==== Merging Project Files

Project files contain references to the objects in the project.
Generally, your project __`+.mwp+` contains the following elements:

* Database information:
** Database tables:
* Descriptors:
* Repository:
** Classes:

Changes in these parts of the `+.mwp+` file are usually caused by
adding, deleting, or renaming project elements.

To merge project files, you will generally need to merge a project file
if another developer has added or removed a descriptor, table, or class,
and checked in the project while you were adding or removing
descriptors, tables, or classes from the same project. To merge the
project’s `+.mwp+` file, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Perform a file comparison between the __.`+mwp+` file in the
repository and your local copy. The file comparison shows the addition
or removal of a project element inside the owner (that is, , , or ).
. Insert the XML script to, or delete from your local __.`+mwp+` file
(inside the _corresponding owner element_). This brings your local code
up-to-date to the current code in the code repository.
. Retrieve any updated files, as indicated by your source control
system.

Your local source now matches the repository.

[#example_merging_projects]## *’’Example: Merging Projects*’’ Another
developer has added and checked in a new *Employee* class descriptor to
the `+com.demo+` package while you were working with the same Workbench
project. To merge your work with the newly changed project, follow these
steps:

[arabic]
. Perform a file comparison on the __.`+mwp+` file to determine the
differences between your local file and the file in the repository. Your
SCM system may show the file in _merge_ status. The file comparison
shows the addition of the tag and a element inside that tag:
+
`+   +``+com.demo.Employee.ClassDescriptor+`
. Insert this XML into your __.`+mwp+` file (inside the element) to
bring it up to date with the current files in the source repository.
. Retrieve any new or updated files from your source control system.
This includes the newly added *Employee* class descriptor.
. Check in files that you have modified.

==== Merging Table, Descriptor, and Class Files

Developers who concurrently modify the same existing table, descriptor,
or class file will create a merge condition for the following files:

* Table: __`+<tableName+`__>`+.xml+` (one for each table)
* Descriptor: _`+<descriptorName.type>+`_`+.xml+` (one for each
descriptor)
* Class: __`+.xml+` (one for each class)

Workbench changes these files when saving a project if you have changed
any of the contents within them (such as adding a mapping to a
descriptor, adding an attribute to a class, or a changing a field
reference in a table).

If another developer has changed an attribute in a table, descriptor, or
class, while you were changing a different mapping on that same
descriptor, you will need to merge your project. To merge your project,
use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Perform a file comparison on the specific `+.xml+` files in merge
status (that is, table, descriptor, or class). The file comparison shows
the addition or removal of an XML element.
. Insert the XML script to, or remove from your local `+.xml+` file to
bring it up to date with the current files in the source repository.

[#example_merging_files]## *’’Example: Merging Files*’’ Another
developer has added and checked in the *firstName* mapping to the
*Employee* class descriptor while you were changing a different mapping
on that same descriptor. To merge your work with the newly changed
project, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Perform a file comparison on the
`+com.demo.Employee.ClassDescriptor.xml+` file located in
__`+/Descriptor/+` directory that is in merge status. The file
comparison shows the addition of the tag and the elements inside that
tag:
+
[source,java]
----
 <mapping>
    <uses-method-accessing>false</uses-method-accessing>
    <inherited>false</inherited>
    <read-only>false</read-only>
    <instance-variable-name>firstName</instance-variable-name>
    <default-field-names>
        <default-field-name>direct field=</default-field-name>
    </default-field-names>
    <field-handle>
        <field-handle>
            <table>EMPLOYEE</table>
            <field-name>F_NAME</field-name>
        </field-handle>
    </field-handle>
 <mapping-class>MWDirectToFieldMapping </mapping-class>
 </mapping>
----
. Insert this XML block into your local
`+com.demo.Employee.ClassDescriptor.xml+` file (inside the existing
element) to bring it up to date to the current files in the source
repository.
. Retrieve any new files noted as missing by your source control system.
This includes any tables or descriptors that may be referenced by the
new mapping.
. Check in files that you have modified.

=== How to Share Project Objects

You can also share project objects by copying the table or descriptor
files into the appropriate directories in the target project.

After copying the files, insert a reference to the table, descriptor, or
class in the appropriate place in the __`+.mwp+` file. All references
contained within the project file must refer to an existing object in
the project.

=== How to Work with Locked Files

When working in a team environment, your source control system may lock
files when you retrieve them from the repository. If Workbench attempts
to save a locked file, the Version Control Assistance dialog box
appears, showing the locked files.’’’’’

Box,title="Version Control Assistance Dialog Box"]

Select one of the following methods to save your project:

* Use your source control system to unlock the files, and then click
*Save*.
* Click *Save As* to save the project to a new location.

Save Projects] for more information.
