Special:Whatlinkshere_Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Queries_(ELUG)[Related
Topics]

EclipseLink enables you to create, read, update, and delete persistent
objects or data using queries in both Java EE and non-Java EE
applications for both relational and nonrelational data sources.

== Query Types

This table lists the query types that you can build in EclipseLink.

[#Table 104-1]##

Query Type

Description

EclipseLink Workbench

Java

Session Queries

A query implicitly constructed and executed by a Session based on input
parameters used to perform the most common data source actions on
objects.

Database Queries

A query also known as a query object query. An instance of DatabaseQuery
that you create and then execute to perform any data source action on
either objects or data. You can further refine a DatabaseQuery by also
creating and configuring its Call (see Call Queries).

Named Queries

An instance of DatabaseQuery stored by name in a Session or a
descriptor’s DescriptorQueryManager where it is constructed and prepared
once. Such a query can then be repeatedly executed by name.

Call Queries

An instance of Call that you create and then either execute directly,
using a special Session API to perform limited data source actions on
data only, or execute indirectly in the context of a DatabaseQuery.
EclipseLink supports Call instances for custom SQL, stored procedures,
and EIS interactions.

Redirect Queries

An instance of MethodBasedQueryRedirector (taking the name of a static
method and the Class in which it is defined as parameters) set on a
named query. When the query is executed, the static method is invoked.

Historical Queries

Any query executed in the context of a historical session using the
time-aware features of the EclipseLink Expression framework.

Interface and Inheritance Queries

Any query that references an interface type or super and subclasses of
an inheritance hierarchy.

Descriptor Query Manager Queries

The DescriptorQueryManager defines a default DatabaseQuery for each
basic data source operation (create, read, update, and delete), and
provides an API with which you can customize either the DatabaseQuery or
its Call.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Basic Query API]
* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Advanced Query API]
* link:#Query_Concepts[Query Concepts]

== Query Concepts

In general, querying a data source means performing an action on or
interacting with the contents of the data source. To do this, you must
be able to perform the following:

* Define an action in a syntax native to the data source being queried
* Apply the action in a controlled fashion
* Manage the results returned by the action (if any)

Specific to EclipseLink, you must also consider how the query affects
the EclipseLink cache. For more information, see
link:#Queries_and_the_Cache[Queries and the Cache].

This section introduces the following query concepts unique to
EclipseLink:

* link:#Call[Call]
* link:#DatabaseQuery[DatabaseQuery]
* link:#Data-Level_and_Object-Level_Queries[Data-Level and Object-Level
Queries]
* link:#Summary_Queries[Summary Queries]
* link:#Descriptor_Query_Manager[Descriptor Query Manager]
* link:#EclipseLink_Expressions[EclipseLink Expressions]
* link:#Query_Keys[Query Keys]
* link:#Query_Languages[Query Languages]

=== Call

In EclipseLink, the `+Call+` object encapsulates an operation or action
on a data source. EclipseLink provides a variety of `+Call+` types such
as structured query language (SQL), Enterprise Java Beans Query Language
(EJB QL), Java Persistence Query Language (JP QL), Extensible Markup
Language (XML), and enterprise information system (EIS).

You can execute a `+Call+` directly or in the context of a
`+DatabaseQuery+`.

=== DatabaseQuery

A `+DatabaseQuery+` object is an abstraction that associates additional
customization and optimization options with the action encapsulated by a
`+Call+`. By separating these options from the `+Call+`, EclipseLink can
provide sophisticated query capabilities across all `+Call+` types.

For more information, see link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries].

=== Data-Level and Object-Level Queries

In EclipseLink, queries can be defined for objects or data, as follows:

* *Object-level* queries (see link:#Object-Level_Read_Query[Object-Level
Read Query] and link:#Object-Level_Modify_Query[Object-Level Modify
Query]) are object-specific and return data as objects in your domain
model. They are the preferred type of query for mapped data. By far,
object-level `+DatabaseQuery+` queries are the most common query used in
EclipseLink.
* *Data-level* queries (see link:#Data-Level_Read_Query[Data-Level Read
Query] and link:#Data-Level_Modify_Query[Data-Level Modify Query]) are
used to query database tables directly, and are an appropriate way to
work with unmapped data.

=== Summary Queries

While data-level queries return raw data and object-level queries return
objects in your domain model, summary queries return data about objects.
EclipseLink provides link:#Partial_Object_Queries[Partial Object
Queries] to return a set of objects with only specific attributes
populated, and link:#Report_Query[Report Queries] to return summarized
(or rolled-up) data for specific attributes of a set of objects.

=== Descriptor Query Manager

In addition to storing named queries applicable to a particular class
(see link:#Named_Queries[Named Queries]), you can also use the
`+DescriptorQueryManager+` to override the default action that
EclipseLink defines for common data source operations. For more
information, see link:#Descriptor_Query_Manager_Queries[Descriptor Query
Manager Queries].

=== EclipseLink Expressions

EclipseLink expressions let you specify query search criteria based on
your domain object model. When you execute the query, EclipseLink
translates these search criteria into the appropriate query language for
your platform.

EclipseLink provides the following two public classes to support
expressions:

* The `+Expression+` class represents an expression that can be anything
from a simple constant to a complex clause with boolean logic. You can
manipulate, group, and integrate expressions.
* The `+ExpressionBuilder+` class is the factory for constructing new
expressions.

You can specify a selection criterion as an `+Expression+` with
`+DatabaseQuery+` method `+setSelectionCriteria+` (see
link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries]), and in a finder that takes an
`+Expression+` (see link:#Expression_Finders[Expression Finders]).

For more information about using EclipseLink expressions, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)[Introduction
to EclipseLink Expressions].

=== Query Keys

A query key is a schema-independent alias for a database field name.
Using a query key, you can refer to a field using a schema-independent
alias. In relational projects only, EclipseLink automatically creates
query keys for all mapped attributes. The name of the query key is the
name of the class attribute specified in your object model.

You can configure query keys in a
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Query_Keys[class
descriptor] or
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Interface_Query_Keys[interface
descriptor].

You can use query keys
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)#Query_Keys_and_Expressions[in
expressions] and to query
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_Queries_on_Variable_One-to-One_Mappings[variable
one-to-one mappings].

=== Query Languages

Using EclipseLink, you can express a query using any of the following
query languages:

* link:#SQL_Queries[SQL Queries]
* link:#JP_QL_Queries[JP QL Queries]
* link:#XML_Queries[XML Queries]
* link:#EIS_Interactions[EIS Interactions]
* link:#Query-by-Example[Query-by-Example]
* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)[Expressions]

In most cases, you can compose a query directly in a given query
language or, preferably, you can construct a `+DatabaseQuery+` with an
appropriate `+Call+` and specify selection criteria using an EclipseLink
`+Expression+`. Although composing a query directly in SQL appears to be
the simplest approach (and for simple operations or operations on
unmapped data, it is), using the `+DatabaseQuery+` approach offers the
compelling advantage of confining your query to your domain object model
and avoiding dependence on data source schema implementation details.

We recommend that you compose your queries using JP QL or
`+Expression+`.

==== SQL Queries

SQL is the most common query language for applications that use a
relational database data source.

You can execute custom SQL directly using `+Session+` methods
`+executeSelectingCall+` and `+executeNonSelectingCall+`, or you can
construct a `+DatabaseQuery+` with an appropriate `+Call+`.

EclipseLink provides a variety of link:#SQL_Calls[SQL `+Call+` objects]
for use with stored procedures and, with Oracle Databases, stored
functions.

EclipseLink also supports PL/SQL call for Oracle stored procedures with
PL/SQL data types. For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using%20a%20StoredProcedureCall[Using
a StoredProcedureCall].

==== JP QL Queries

See
link:Developing%20Applications%20Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20(ELUG)[What
You May Need to Know About Querying with Java Persistence Query
Language] for more information.

==== XML Queries

You can use EclipseLink XML to query XML data stored in an Oracle
Database XMLType field. For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#CHDFIFEF[Direct-to-XMLType
Mapping] and
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)#CJADHIHG[XMLType
Functions].

==== EIS Interactions

When you execute an EclipseLink query using an
link:#Enterprise_Information_System_(EIS)_Interactions[EIS `+Call+`],
EclipseLink converts your selection criteria into an XML format
appropriate for your JCA adapter.

If supported by your JCA adapter, you can use the XQuery language by
executing an link:#XQueryInteraction[XQueryInteraction] either directly
or in the context of a `+DatabaseQuery+`.

==== Query-by-Example

Query-by-example is a simple and intuitive way to express a query. To
specify a query-by-example, provide a sample instance of the persistent
object to query, and set appropriate values on only the data members on
which you wish to query.

You can use a constructor with a reference class argument to create a
sample instance or example object. Alternatively, you can use a
combination of any other type of constructor and a `+setReferenceClass+`
method of your query object. If you fail to specify the reference class,
a `+QueryException+` will be thrown.

Query-by-example lets you query for an object based on any attribute
that uses a direct mapping or a one-to-one relationship (including those
with nesting).

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: Query-by-example does not support any other relationship
mapping types.
|===

Set only the attributes on which you base the query; set all other
attributes to `+null+`. By default, EclipseLink ignores attributes in
the sample instance that contain `+null+`, zero (0), empty strings, and
`+FALSE+`. You can modify this list of values (and define other query by
example options) by specifying
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Defining_a_QueryByExamplePolicy[a
`+QueryByExamplePolicy+`].

Query-by-example uses the `+AND+` operator to tie the attribute
comparisons together. By default, attribute values in the sample
instance are compared against corresponding values of candidate objects
using `+EQUALS+` operator. You can modify this behaviour using the
`+QueryByExamplePolicy+`.

Both `+ReadAllQuery+` and `+ReadObjectQuery+` provide a
`+setExampleObject+` method and `+setQueryByExamplePolicy+` method that
you can use to specify selection criteria based on an example object
instance.

For more information and examples, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Reading_Objects_Using_Query-By-Example[Reading
Objects Using Query-By-Example].

== Building Queries

You can build queries using Workbench or Java, using the EclipseLink
API.

Some queries are implicitly constructed for you based on passed in
arguments and executed in one step (for example, session queries, as
described in link:#Session_Queries[Session Queries]) and others you
explicitly create, configure, and then execute (for example,
link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries]).

For more information, see the following:

* link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Basic Query API]
* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Advanced Query API]

== Executing Queries

In EclipseLink, you execute most queries using the `+Session+` API
summarized in the link:#Table_104-2[Session Methods for Executing a
Query] table.

[#Table 104-2]## *_Session Methods for Executing a Query_*

Query Type

Session Method

Advantages and Disadvantages

Session Queries

readObjectreadAllObjects writeObject writeAllObjects deleteObject
deleteAllObjects insertObject updateObject

Advantages: the most convenient way to perform common data source
operations on objects.

Disadvantages: less control over query execution and results; less
efficient for frequently executed queries.

Database Queries Named Queries Redirect Queries

executeQuery

Advantages: greatest configuration and execution flexibility; can take
advantage of named queries for efficiency.

Disadvantages: you must explicitly create and configure DatabaseQuery
and possibly Call objects.

Call Queries

executeSelectingCall executeNonSelectingCall

Advantages: convenient way to directly apply an action to unmapped data.

Disadvantages: least control over query execution and results; your
application must do more work to handle raw data results.

Note: We recommend that you perform all data source operations using a
unit of work: doing so is the most efficient way to manage transactions,
concurrency, and referential constraints. For more information, see
Introduction to EclipseLink Transactions.

Alternatively, you can execute queries outside of a unit of work using a
session API directly, but doing so places greater responsibility on your
application to manage transactions, concurrency, and referential
constraints.

EclipseLink executes `+DescriptorQueryManager+` queries when you execute
a session query. For more information, see
link:#Descriptor_Query_Manager_Queries[Descriptor Query Manager
Queries].

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*WARNING:* Allowing an unverified SQL string to be passed into methods
(for example:
`+setSQLString(String sql), readAllObjects(Class class, String sql)+`
methods) makes your application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
|===

For more information, see the following:

* link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Basic Query API]
* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Advanced Query API]

== Handling Query Results

EclipseLink queries generally return Java objects as their result set.
EclipseLink queries can return any of the following:

* Entire objects, with all attributes populated and the object reflected
in the cache.
* link:#Collection_Query_Results[Collections of objects].
* Partial objects, with only the attributes you specify populated and
without the object reflected in the cache (see
link:#Report_Query_Results[Report Query Results]).
* link:#Stream_and_Cursor_Query_Results[Streams of objects].
* Collections of records.
* Report summaries.

=== Collection Query Results

A collection is a group of Java objects contained by an instance of
`+Collection+` or `+Map+`

By default, queries that return more than one object return their
results in a `+Vector+`.

You can configure EclipseLink to return query results in any concrete
instance of `+Collection+` or `+Map+`.

Collection results are supported by all EclipseLink query types.

For information and examples on how to configure and handle collection
query results, see link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Handling
Collection Query Results].

=== Report Query Results

A `+ReportQuery+` (a type of partial object query) returns summary data
for selected objects using the database reporting functions and features
supported by your platform. Although the report query returns data (not
objects), it does enable you to query the returned data and specify it
at the object level.

By default, a `+ReportQuery+` returns a collection (see
link:#Collection_Query_Results[Collection Query Results]) of
`+ReportQueryResult+` objects, one collection per database row returned.
You can use the `+ReportQuery+` API to configure how a `+ReportQuery+`
returns its results. For more information see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Handling Report Query
Results].

For more information, see the following:

* link:#Report_Query[Report Query]
* link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Handling_Report_Query_Results[Handling
Report Query Results]
* link:#Partial_Object_Queries[Partial Object Queries].

=== Stream and Cursor Query Results

A stream is a view of a collection, which can be a file, a device, or a
`+Vector+`. A stream provides access to the collection, one element at a
time in sequence. This makes it possible to implement stream classes in
which the stream does not contain all the objects of a collection at the
same time.

Large result sets can be resource-intensive to collect and process. To
improve performance and give the client more control over the returned
results, configure EclipseLink queries to use a cursor or stream.

Cursors & streams are supported by all subclasses of `+DataReadQuery+`
and `+ReadAllQuery+`.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Handling_Cursor_and_Stream_Query_Results[Handling
Cursor and Stream Query Results].

== Session Queries

Sessions provide query methods that lets you perform the object
operations listed in the following table.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: We recommend that you perform all data source operations using
a unit of work: doing so is the most efficient way to manage
transactions, concurrency, and referential constraints. For more
information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Transactions_(ELUG)[Introduction
to EclipseLink Transactions].
|===

These methods implicitly construct and execute a `+DatabaseQuery+` based
on any of the following input parameters and return `+Object+` or
`+Object+` collection:

* Reference `+Class+` (the `+Class+` of objects that the query accesses)
* Reference `+Class+` and `+Call+`
* Reference `+Class+` and `+Expression+`
* Example object with primary key set

These methods are a convenient way to perform the most common data
source operations on objects.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*WARNING:* Allowing an unverified SQL string to be passed into these
methods makes your application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
|===

To access all configurable options to further refine and optimize a
query, consider using a corresponding `+DatabaseQuery+` directly. For
more information, see link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries].

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_Session_Queries[Using
Session Queries].

=== Read-Object Session Queries

Read-object queries return the first instance of an `+Object+` that
matches the specified selection criteria, and read-all object queries
return all such instances.

You can also pass in a domain `+Object+` with its primary key set and
EclipseLink will construct and execute a read-object query to select
that object. This is one form of
link:#Query-by-Example[Query-by-Example].

For more information, see link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How
to Read Objects with a Session Query].

=== Create, Update, and Delete Object Session Queries

We recommend that you create and update objects using a unit of work:
doing so is the most efficient way to manage transactions, concurrency,
and referential constraints. For more information, see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Transactions_(ELUG)[Introduction to
EclipseLink Transactions].

However, you can also create and update objects using a session query.
These session queries are a convenient way to modify objects directly on
the database when you manage simple, nonbusiness object data that has no
relationships (for example, user preferences).

If you know an object is new, you can use an `+insertObject+` method to
avoid having EclipseLink perform an existence check. If you do not know
if an object is new, use the `+updateObject+`, `+writeObject+`, or
`+writeAllObject+` methods: EclipseLink performs an existence check if
necessary.

When you execute a write session query, it writes both the object and
its privately owned parts to the database. To manage this behavior, use
a corresponding `+DatabaseQuery+` (see
link:#Object-Level_Modify_Queries_and_Privately_Owned_Parts[Object-Level
Modify Queries and Privately Owned Parts]).

Using the `+Session+` method `+deleteObject+`, you can delete a specific
object. Using the Session method `+deleteAllObjects+`, you can delete a
collection of objects. Each specified object and all its privately owned
parts are deleted. In the case of `+deleteAllObjects+`, all deletions
are performed within a single transaction.

For more information, see link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How
to Create&#44; Update&#44; and Delete Objects with a Session Query].

== Database Queries

All session types provide an `+executeQuery+` method that takes any of
the following types of `+DatabaseQuery+`:

* link:#Object-Level_Read_Query[Object-Level Read Query]
* link:#Data-Level_Read_Query[Data-Level Read Query]
* link:#Object-Level_Modify_Query[Object-Level Modify Query]
* link:#Data-Level_Modify_Query[Data-Level Modify Query]
* link:#Report_Query[Report Query]

Using `+DatabaseQuery+` method `+setCall+`, you can define your own
`+Call+` to accommodate a variety of data source options such as SQL
(including stored procedures and stored functions), EJB QL queries, and
EIS interactions. For more information, see link:#Call_Queries[Call
Queries].

Using `+DatabaseQuery+` method `+setSelectionCriteria+`, you can specify
your selection criteria using an EclipseLink `+Expression+`. For more
information, see link:#EclipseLink_Expressions[EclipseLink Expressions].

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_DatabaseQuery_Queries[Using
DatabaseQuery Queries].

=== Object-Level Read Query

Using an `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+`, you can query your data source and
return `+Object+` instances that match the specified selection criteria.
This section describes the following:

* link:#ReadObjectQuery[ReadObjectQuery]
* link:#ReadAllQuery[ReadAllQuery]
* link:#Partial_Object_Queries[Partial Object Queries]
* link:#Read-Only_Query[Read-Only Query]
* link:#Join_Reading_and_Object-Level_Read_Queries[Join Reading and
Object-Level Read Queries]
* link:#Fetch_Groups_and_Object-Level_Read_Queries[Fetch Groups and
Object-Level Read Queries]

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#How_to_Read_Objects_Using_a_DatabaseQuery[How
to Read Objects Using a DatabaseQuery].

==== ReadObjectQuery

Using a `+ReadObjectQuery+`, you can query your data source and return
the first object that matches the specified selection criteria.

==== ReadAllQuery

Using a `+ReadAllQuery+`, you can query your data source and return a
`+Collection+` of all the objects that match the specified selection
criteria.

==== Partial Object Queries

By default, an `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` returns all attributes of the
objects read.

If you require only certain attributes from selected objects, you can
create a partial object query by using `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` method
`+addPartialAttributes+`. Using this method, you can improve query
performance by making EclipseLink return objects with only specified
attributes populated.

Applications frequently use partial object queries to compile a list for
further selection. For example, a query to find the names and addresses
of all employees over the age of 40 returns a list of data (the names
and addresses) that partially represents objects (the employees). A
common next step is to present this list so the user can select the
required object or objects from the list. Later retrieval of a complete
object is simplified because EclipseLink always includes the primary key
attribute (even if you do not add it as a partial attribute.

Consider the following when you use partial object queries:

* You cannot edit or cache partial objects.
* Unspecified attributes will be left `+null+`.
* You cannot have two partial attributes of the same type.
* You cannot add a partial attribute which is of the same type as the
class being queried.

If you require only summary information for certain attributes from
selected objects, it is more efficient to use a
link:#Report_Query[Report Query].

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Reading_Objects_Using_Partial_Object_Queries[Reading
Objects Using Partial Object Queries].

==== Read-Only Query

In cases where you know that data is read-only, you can improve
performance by specifying a query as read-only: this tells EclipseLink
that any object returned by the query is immutable.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Read-Only_Descriptors[Configuring
Read-Only Descriptors]
* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_Read-Only_Queries[Using
Read-Only Queries]
* link:Optimizing%20the%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)#How_to_Use_Read-Only_Queries_for_Optimization[How
to Use Read-Only Queries for Optimization]

==== Join Reading and Object-Level Read Queries

Join reading is a query optimization feature that allows a single query
for a class to return the data to build the instances of that class and
its related objects. Use this feature to improve query performance by
reducing database access. By default, relationships are not join-read:
each relationship is fetched separately when accessed if you are using
indirection (lazy loading) or as a separate database query if you are
not using indirection. For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Indirection (Lazy Loading)].

You can use join reading with `+ReadObjectQuery+` and `+ReadAllQuery+`
to join the mapped relationships that the link:#Table_104-4[Join Reading
by Mapping Type] table lists. Join reading is not currently supported
for any other relationship mappings.

ReadObjectQuery

One-to-One Mapping

One-to-Many Mapping

ReadAllQuery

Aggregate Collection Mapping

Join reading can specify multiple and nested relationships to be joined.
Nested joins are expressed through using expressions (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)[Expressions
for Joining and Complex Relationships]).

Outer joins can also be used with join reading through using the
expression outer join API. If an outer join is not used, objects with
missing one-to-one relationships or empty one-to-many relationships will
be filtered from the result set. You can also configure an object-level
read query to allow inherited subclasses to be outer-joined to avoid the
cost of a single query per class. You can also specify inner or outer
joins using the `+useInnerJoinFetch+` or `+useOuterJoinFetch+` method of
any of the mappings listed in the link:#Table_104-4[Join Reading by
Mapping Type] table.

You can use join reading with custom SQL or stored procedures, but the
query must ensure that all of the required data to build all of the
join-read objects is returned. If the result set includes the same
tables or fields, they must be returned in the same table order as
EclipseLink would have generated.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Join Reading with
ObjectLevelReadQuery].

===== Avoiding Join-Reading Duplicate Data

Join reading can result in returning duplicate data if a one-to-many or
a shared one-to-one relationship is joined. Although EclipseLink
correctly filters the duplicate results from the object result, the
duplicate data still must be fetched from the database and can degrade
performance, especially if multiple one-to-many relationships are
joined. In general, batch reading can be used as a better alternative to
join reading, as it does not require fetching duplicate data.

We recommend that you use one-to-many joining with caution, because it
does not scale well in many situations.

Because the main cost of a `+ReadObjectQuery+` is SQL execution, the
performance of a one-to-many join in this case is usually better than a
query without joining.

However, because the main cost of a `+ReadAllObjectQuery+` is
row-fetching, which the duplicate data of a join increases, the
performance of a one-to-many join in this case is less efficient than
batch reading in many scenarios (even though one-to-many joining is more
efficient than reading the objects one-by-one).

This is mainly due to the fact that a one-to-many join reads in
duplicate data: the data for each source object will be duplicated for
each target object. Depending on the size of the one-to-many
relationship and the size of the source object’s row, this can become
very inefficient, especially if the source object has a Large Object
(LOB).

If you use multiple or nested one-to-many joins in the same query, the
problem is compounded: the source object’s row is duplicated _n*m_
times, and each target object _n_ and _m_ times respectively. This can
become a major performance issue.

To handle empty collections, you must use outer joins, so the queries
can easily become very database intensive. Batch reading has the
advantage of only returning the required data, and does not require
outer joins.

We recommend that you use batch reading to optimize querying
relationships in read-all applications.

For more information, see the following:

==== Fetch Groups and Object-Level Read Queries

You can use a fetch group with a `+ReadObjectQuery+` or
`+ReadAllQuery+`. When you execute the query, EclipseLink retrieves only
the attributes in the fetch group. EclipseLink automatically executes a
query to fetch all the attributes excluded from this subset when and if
you call a getter method on any one of the excluded attributes.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)[Fetch Groups]
* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Queries with Fetch
Groups]

=== Data-Level Read Query

Using a `+DataLevelReadQuery+`, you can query your data source and
return `+Object+` instances that match the specified selection criteria.
This section describes the following:

* link:#DataReadQuery[DataReadQuery]
* link:#DirectReadQuery[DirectReadQuery]
* link:#ValueReadQuery[ValueReadQuery]

For more information, see link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How
to Read Data with a DatabaseQuery].

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*WARNING:* Allowing an unverified SQL string to be passed into
constructors of such objects as `+DataReadQuery+`, `+DirectReadQuery+`
and `+ValueReadQuery+` makes your application vulnerable to SQL
injection attacks.
|===

==== DataReadQuery

Use a `+DataReadQuery+` to execute a selecting SQL string that returns a
`+Collection+` of the `+Record+` objects representing the result set.

==== DirectReadQuery

Use a `+DirectReadQuery+` to read a single column of data (that is, one
field) that returns a `+Collection+` of values representing the result
set.

==== ValueReadQuery

Use a `+ValueReadQuery+` to read a single data value (that is, one
field). A single data value is returned, or null if no rows are
returned.

=== Object-Level Modify Query

With an `+ObjectLevelModifyQuery+`, you can query your data source to
create, update, and delete objects, using the following:

* link:#WriteObjectQuery[WriteObjectQuery]
* link:#UpdateObjectQuery[UpdateObjectQuery]
* link:#InsertObjectQuery[InsertObjectQuery]
* link:#DeleteObjectQuery[DeleteObjectQuery]
* link:#UpdateAllQuery[UpdateAllQuery]
* link:#DeleteAllQuery[DeleteAllQuery]
* link:#Object-Level_Modify_Queries_and_Privately_Owned_Parts[Object-Level
Modify Queries and Privately Owned Parts]

For more information, see link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How
to Create&#44; Update&#44; and Delete Objects with a DatabaseQuery].

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* We recommend that you create and update objects using an
EclipseLink `+UnitOfWork+`: doing so is the most efficient way to manage
transactions, concurrency, and referential constraints. For more
information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Transactions_(ELUG)[Introduction
to EclipseLink Transactions].
|===

==== WriteObjectQuery

If you do not know whether or not an object is new, use a
`+WriteObjectQuery+`: EclipseLink performs an existence check if
necessary to determine whether to perform an insert or an update.

If you do know whether or not an object exists, you can avoid the
existence check by using an link:#UpdateObjectQuery[UpdateObjectQuery]
or link:#InsertObjectQuery[InsertObjectQuery].

==== UpdateObjectQuery

If you know that the object you want to modify exists, use an
`+UpdateObjectQuery+` to avoid having EclipseLink perform an existence
check.

==== InsertObjectQuery

If you know an object is new, you can use an `+InsertObjectQuery+` to
avoid having EclipseLink perform an existence check.

==== DeleteObjectQuery

To delete a specific object, construct a `+DeleteObjectQuery+` with a
single specific object as an argument.

==== UpdateAllQuery

The `+UpdateAllQuery+` allows you to take an expression and update a set
of objects (at the object level) without loading the objects into
memory. You can updated to either a specific or relative value. For
example, you can set the value to 5 or to increase by 5 percent.

For more information, see link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How
to Create&#44; Update&#44; and Delete Objects with a DatabaseQuery].

==== DeleteAllQuery

To delete multiple objects, construct a `+DeleteAllQuery+` and use its
`+setObjects+` method to configure the collection of specific objects to
delete. Use the `+DeleteAllQuery+` method `+setReferenceClass+` to
configure the reference class of the objects to delete. Each specified
object is deleted, but its privately owned parts are not.

In the case of a `+DeleteAllQuery+`, all deletions are performed within
a single transaction.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using DeleteAll Queries].

==== Object-Level Modify Queries and Privately Owned Parts

When you execute a create or update object `+DatabaseQuery+`, it writes
both the object and its privately owned parts to the database by
default. To create a query that does not update privately owned parts,
use the `+DatabaseQuery+` method `+dontCascadeParts+`. Use this method
to do the following:

* Increase performance when you know that only the object’s direct
attributes have changed.
* Manually resolve referential integrity dependencies when you write
large groups of new, independent objects.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: Because the unit of work resolves referential integrity
internally, this method is not required if you use the unit of work to
write to the data source. For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Transactions_(ELUG)[Introduction
to EclipseLink Transactions].
|===

=== Data-Level Modify Query

Using a `+DataModifyQuery+`, you can query your data source to execute a
nonselecting SQL statement. It is equivalent to `+Session+` method
`+executeNonSelectingCall+`.

For more information, see link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How
to Update Data with a DatabaseQuery].

=== Report Query

If you want to summarize (or roll up) certain attributes of a set of
objects, you can use a `+ReportQuery+`.

A `+ReportQuery+` returns summary data from a set of objects and their
related objects. That is, it returns data about objects. It can also
return multiple objects. A `+ReportQuery+` lets you you query and
specify the data at the object level. To build a report query, you
specify the search criteria, the data you require about the objects, and
how that data should be summarized.

For example, you can create a report query to compute the average age of
all employees in your company. The report query is not interested in the
specific objects (the employees), but rather, summary information about
them (their average age).

A `+ReportQuery+` lets you do the following:

* Specify a subset of the object’s attributes and its related object’s
attributes, which allows you to query for lightweight information.
* Build complex object-level expressions for the selection criteria and
ordering criteria.
* Use data source aggregation functions (supported by your platform),
such as `+SUM+`, `+MIN+`, `+MAX+`, `+AVG+`, and `+COUNT+`.
* Use expressions to group data.
* Request primary key attributes with each `+ReportQueryResult+`. This
makes it easy to request the real object from a lightweight result.

A `+ReportQuery+` is the most efficient form of
link:#Partial_Object_Queries[Partial Object Queries], because it takes
advantage of the reporting capabilities of your data source (if
available). We recommend that you use `+ReportQuery+` to do partial
object queries.

The `+ReportQuery+` API returns a collection of `+ReportQueryResult+`
objects, similar in structure and behavior to a `+Record+` or a `+Map+`.
For more information, see link:#Report_Query_Results[Report Query
Results].

Queries]

== Named Queries

When you use a session query method like `+readAllObjects+` (see
link:#Session_Queries[Session Queries]), EclipseLink creates a
corresponding `+ReadAllQuery+`, which builds other objects it needs to
perform its task. When EclipseLink finishes execution of the
`+readAllObjects+` method, these objects are discarded. Each time you
call this session method, EclipseLink creates these related objects
again, uses them once, and then discards them.

Alternatively, you can create a `+DatabaseQuery+` (see
link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries]) and store it by name at the
descriptor-level (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring Named Queries at
the Descriptor Level]) or session-level (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)[Configuring Named Queries at the
Session Level]).

EclipseLink prepares a named query once, and it (and all its associated
supporting objects) can be efficiently reused thereafter making a named
query well suited for frequently executed operations.

Using the `+Session+` API (see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Named Queries]), you can
execute these queries by name, passing in any required arguments.

*When to Use Named Queries*

For a reasonably complex query that you execute frequently, you should
consider making the query a named query.

If a query is global to a project,
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Named_Queries_at_the_Session_Level[configure
the named query at the session level].

If a query is global to a `+Class+`,
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Named_Queries_at_the_Descriptor_Level[configure
the named query at the descriptor level]. For more information about
descriptor level query configuration, see
link:#Descriptor_Query_Manager_Queries[Descriptor Query Manager
Queries].

For a very complex query, you can delegate query execution to your own
static method using a special form of a named query called a
link:#Redirect_Queries[Redirect Query].

*When Not to Use Named Queries*

Rarely used queries may be more efficient when built on an as-needed
basis. If you seldom use a given query, it may not be worthwhile to
build and store that query when you invoke a session.

== Call Queries

All session types provide `+executeSelectingCall+` and
`+executeNonSelectingCall+` methods that take any of the following
`+Call+` types:

* link:#SQL_Calls[SQL Calls]
* link:#Enterprise_Information_System_(EIS)_Interactions[EIS
Interactions]

You can also execute a `+Call+` in the context of a `+DatabaseQuery+`.
For more information on `+DatabaseQuery+`, see
link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries].

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*WARNING:* Allowing an unverified SQL string to be passed into methods
(for example: `+executeSelectingCall(String sql)+` method) makes your
application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
|===

=== SQL Calls

SQL calls access fields in a relational database. EclipseLink supports
the following SQL calls:

* link:##SQLCall[SQLCall]
* link:#StoredProcedureCall[StoredProcedureCall]
* link:#StoredFunctionCall[StoredFunctionCall]

Using the `+Call+` API (or SQL string conventions), you can specify
input, output, and input-output parameters and assign values for input
and input/output parameters.

Using a descriptor `+ReturningPolicy+`, you can control whether or not
EclipseLink writes a parameter out, retrieves a value generated by the
database, or both. For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring Returning
Policy].

==== SQLCall

Using a `+SQLCall+`, you can specify any arbitrary SQL statement and
execute it on a data source.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*WARNING:* Allowing an unverified SQL string to be passed into methods
makes your application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
|===

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_a_SQLCall[Using a
SQLCall].

==== StoredProcedureCall

A stored procedure is composed of one or more procedural language
statements, such as Procedural Language/Structured Query Language
(PLSQL), stored by name in the database. Most relational databases
support stored procedures.

You invoke a stored procedure to execute logic and access data from the
data source.

Using a `+StoredProcedureCall+`, you can detect execution errors,
specify input parameters, output parameters, and input/output
parameters. However, stored procedures do not provide a return value.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_a_StoredProcedureCall[Using
a StoredProcedureCall].

==== StoredFunctionCall

A stored function is an Oracle Database feature that provides all the
functionality of a stored procedure as well as the ability to return a
value.

Using a `+StoredFunctionCall+`, you can specify all the features of a
`+StoredProcedureCall+` as well as the field name of the return value.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_a_StoredFunctionCall[Using
a StoredFunctionCall].

=== Enterprise Information System (EIS) Interactions

To invoke a query through a Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA) adapter
to a remote EIS, you use an `+EISInteraction+`, an instance of `+Call+`.
EclipseLink supports the following `+EISInteraction+` types:

* link:#IndexedInteraction[IndexedInteraction]
* link:#MappedInteraction[MappedInteraction]
* link:#XMLInteraction[XMLInteraction]
* link:#XQueryInteraction[XQueryInteraction]
* link:#QueryStringInteraction[QueryStringInteraction]

In each of these interactions, you specify a functional interface
(similar to a stored procedure) that identifies the function to invoke
on the EIS. This functional interface contains the following:

* the function name;
* the record name (if different than the function name);
* a list of input arguments;
* a list of output arguments.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_EIS_Projects[Introduction
to EIS Projects]
* link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_EIS_Interactions[Using
EIS Interactions]

==== IndexedInteraction

In an `+IndexedInteraction+`, you exchange data with the EIS using
indexed records. The order of the specification of the arguments must
match the order of the values defined in the indexed record.

==== MappedInteraction

In a `+MappedInteraction+`, you exchange data with the EIS using mapped
records. The arguments you specify map by name to fields in the mapped
record.

==== XMLInteraction

An `+XMLInteraction+` is a `+MappedInteraction+` that maps data to an
XML record. For an `+XMLInteraction+`, you may also provide an optional
root element name.

==== XQueryInteraction

If your JCA adapter supports the XQuery dynamic query language, you can
use an `+XQueryInteraction+`, which is an `+XMLInteraction+` that lets
you specify your XQuery string.

==== QueryStringInteraction

If your JCA adapter supports a query string based dynamic query
language, you can use a `+QueryStringInteraction+`, which is a
`+MappedInteraction+` that lets you specify the dynamic query string.

== Redirect Queries

To accommodate complex query logic, you can implement a *redirect
query*: a named query that delegates query execution control to your
application. For more information, see link:#Named_Queries[Named
Queries].

Redirect queries lets you define the query implementation in code as a
static method. When you invoke the query, the call redirects to the
specified static method. Redirect queries accept any arbitrary
parameters passed into them packaged in a `+Vector+`.

Although most EclipseLink queries search for objects directly, a
redirect query generally invokes a method that exists on another class
and waits for the results. Redirect queries let you build and use
complex operations, including operations that might not otherwise be
possible within the query framework.

By delegating query invocation to a method you provide, redirect queries
let you dynamically make decisions about how a query should be executed
based on argument values.

Using a redirect query, you can do the following:

* Dynamically configure the query options based on the arguments (for
example, ordering and query optimization).
* Dynamically define the selection criteria based on the arguments.
* Pass query-by-example objects or expressions as the arguments.
* Post-process the query results.
* Perform multiple queries or special operations.

If you execute the query on a `+UnitOfWork+`, the results register with
that instance of `+UnitOfWork+`, so any objects you attempt to retrieve
with the invoke method must come from the `+Session+` cache.

To create a redirect query, you implement the `+QueryRedirector+`
interface and set your implementation on a named query.

We recommend that you take advantage of the
`+MethodBasedQueryRedirector+`, an instance of `+QueryRedirector+` that
EclipseLink provides. It takes the name of a static method and the
`+Class+` in which it is defined as parameters. When you set a
`+MethodBasedQueryRedirector+` on a named query, whenever
`+invokeQuery+` method is called on this instance, EclipseLink uses
reflection to invoke your static method instead.

The advantages of using a `+MethodBasedQueryRedirector+` are as follows:

* You can specify the static method and its `+Class+` dynamically.
* The class that provides the static method does not need to implement
`+QueryRedirector+`.
* Your static method can have any name.
* You can restrict the parameters to your static method to only a
`+Session+` and a `+Vector+` of arguments.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_Redirect_Queries[Using
Redirect Queries].

== Historical Queries

By default, a session represents a view of the most current version of
objects and when you execute a query in that session, it returns the
most current version of selected objects.

If your data source maintains past or historical versions of objects,
you can configure EclipseLink to access this historical data (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Sessions%20(ELUG)[Historical
Sessions]).

Once you configure EclipseLink to take advantage of this historical
data, you can access historical versions using the historical queries
that the following table summarizes.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* Flashback queries do not support view selects. This means you
cannot use a flashback query on objects with an inheritance policy for
read-all-subclasses views. For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)#Descriptors_and_Inheritance[Descriptors
and Inheritance].

`+OraclePlatform+` or EclipseLink `+HistoryPolicy+` using the
`+acquireHistoricalSession+` method passing in an `+AsOfClause+`.

=== Using an ObjectLevelReadQuery with an AsOfClause

You can query historical versions of objects using an
`+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` configured with an `+AsOfClause+` (set by
`+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` method `+setAsOfClause+`) that specifies a
point in time that applies to every `+Expression+` used in the query.

This type of historical query lets you query a static snapshot of object
versions as of the specified time.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: To prevent corrupting the global shared cache with old versions
of objects, you must set `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` method
`+maintainCache+` to `+false+` in this historical query. If you do not,
EclipseLink will throw an exception when you execute the query.
|===

For more information and examples of using an `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+`
with an `+AsOfClause+`, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_Historical_Queries[Using
Historical Queries].

=== Using an ObjectLevelReadQuery with Expression Operator asOf

You can query historical versions of objects using an
`+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` (such as `+ReadObjectQuery+` or
`+ReadAllQuery+`) containing one or more expressions that use
`+Expression+` operator `+asOf+` to specify a point in time on an
`+Expression+`-by-`+Expression+` basis.

This type of historical query lets you combine both current and
historical versions of objects in the same query.

If you configure the `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` with an `+AsOfClause+`,
that point in time overrides the point in time specified in any
`+Expression+` in the query (see
link:#Using_an_ObjectLevelReadQuery_with_an_AsOfClause[Using an
ObjectLevelReadQuery with an AsOfClause]).

For more information and examples of using an `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+`
with `+Expression+` operator `+asOf+`, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#Using_Historical_Queries[Using
Historical Queries].

=== Using an ObjectLevelReadQuery in a Historical Session

Given a session that maintains historical versions of objects (based on
an appropriate `+OraclePlatform+` or EclipseLink `+HistoryPolicy+`), you
can use `+Session+` method `+acquireHistoricalSession+` passing in an
`+AsOfClause+` that specifies a point in time that applies to all
queries and expressions.

This method returns a lightweight, read-only snapshot of object versions
as of the specified time. The cache used in this type of session is
isolated from the global shared cache. You do not need to set
`+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` method `+maintainCache+` to `+false+` in this
case.

For more information and examples of using an `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+`
with a historical session, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Historical Queries].

== Interface and Inheritance Queries

When you define an interface descriptor (see
link:Creating%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Creating Relational
Interface Descriptors]), you can perform queries on interfaces and
inheritance hierarchies.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Querying on Interfaces]
* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Querying on an
Inheritance Hierarchy]

== Oracle Extensions

When you use EclipseLink with an Oracle Database, you can make use of
the following Oracle-specific query features from within your
EclipseLink applications:

* link:#Hints[Hints]
* link:#Hierarchical_Queries[Hierarchical Queries]
* link:#Flashback_Queries[Flashback Queries]
* link:#Stored_Functions[Stored Functions]

=== Hints

Oracle lets you specify SQL query additions called hints that can
influence how the database server SQL optimizer works. This lets you
influence decisions usually reserved for the optimizer. You use hints to
specify things such as join order for a join statement, or the
optimization approach for a SQL call.

You specify hints using the `+DatabaseQuery+` method `+setHintString+`.

For more information, see the following:

* link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries]
* link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#How_to_Use_Oracle_Hints[How
to Use Oracle Hints]
* Your database _Performance Tuning Guide and Reference_.

=== Hierarchical Queries

Oracle Database Hierarchical Queries mechanism lets you select database
rows based on hierarchical order. For example, you can design a query
that reads the row of a given employee, followed by the rows of people
the employee manages, followed by their managed employees, and so on.

You specify a hierarchical query clause using `+DatabaseQuery+` subclass
`+ReadAllQuery+` method `+setHierarchicalQueryClause+`. For more
information on `+DatabaseQuery+` queries, see
link:#Database_Queries[Database Queries].

For more information on configuring a `+ReadAllQuery+` with an Oracle
hierarchical query clause, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)#How_to_Use_Hierarchical_Queries[How
to Use Hierarchical Queries].

=== Flashback Queries

When using EclipseLink with Oracle9i (or later), you can acquire a
special historical session where all objects are read as of a past time,
and then you can express read queries depending on how your objects are
changing over time.

For more information, see link:#Historical_Queries[Historical Queries].

=== Stored Functions

A stored function is an Oracle Database mechanism that provides all the
capabilities of a stored procedure in addition to returning a value.

For more information, see link:#StoredFunctionCall[StoredFunctionCall].

== Descriptor Query Manager Queries

Each `+Descriptor+` owns an instance of `+DescriptorQueryManager+` that
you can use for the following:

* Configuring named queries (see
link:#How_to_Configure_Named_Queries[How to Configure Named Queries])
* Configuring default query implementation (see
link:#How_to_Configure_Default_Query_Implementations[How to Configure
Default Query Implementations])
* Configuring additional join expressions (see
link:#How_to_Configure_Additional_Join_Expressions[How to Configure
Additional Join Expressions])

=== How to Configure Named Queries

The `+DescriptorQueryManager+` provides API for storing and retrieving
frequently used queries by name.

For more information, see link:#Named_Queries[Named Queries].

=== How to Configure Default Query Implementations

The `+DescriptorQueryManager+` of each `+Descriptor+` lets you customize
the query implementation that EclipseLink uses for the following data
source operations:

* insert object
* update object
* read object
* read all objects
* delete object

For example, if you need to insert an object using a stored procedure,
you can override the default `+SQLCall+` used by the
`+DescriptorQueryManager+` insert object query.

Whenever you execute a query on a given `+Class+`, EclipseLink consults
the `+DescriptorQueryManager+` to determine how to perform the given
data source operation.

You can use this capability for a variety of purposes such as to extend
EclipseLink behavior, access nonrelational data, or use stored
procedures or customized SQL calls.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*WARNING:* Allowing an unverified SQL string to be passed into methods
makes your application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
|===

For information and examples on customizing these default query
implementations, see the following:

* link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring
Custom SQL Queries for Basic Persistence Operations]
* link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring Custom
EIS Interactions for Basic Persistence Operations]

=== How to Configure Additional Join Expressions

You can configure the `+DescriptorQueryManager+` to automatically append
an expression to every query it performs on a class. For example, you
can add an expression that filters the data source for the valid
instances of a given class.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Appending Additional Join
Expressions].

== Queries and the Cache

When you execute a query, EclipseLink retrieves the information from
either the database or the EclipseLink session cache. You can configure
the way queries use the EclipseLink cache to optimize performance.

EclipseLink maintains a client-side cache to reduce the number of read
operations required from the database. EclipseLink caches objects
written to and read from the database to maintain object identity. The
sequence in which a query checks the cache and database affects query
performance. By default, primary key queries check the cache before
accessing the database, and all queries check the cache before
rebuilding an object from its row.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* You can override the default behavior in the caching policy
configuration information in the EclipseLink descriptor. For more
information, see link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)[Explicit Query
Refreshes].
|===

This section illustrates ways to manipulate the relationship between
query and cache, and explains the following:

* link:#How_to_Configure_the_Cache[How to Configure the Cache]
* link:#How_to_Use_In-Memory_Queries[How to Use In-Memory Queries]
* link:#Primary_Key_Queries_and_the_Cache[Primary Key Queries and the
Cache]

Query Results in the Session Cache]
* link:#How_to_Cache_Query_Results_in_the_Query_Cache[How to Cache Query
Results in the Query Cache]

=== How to Configure the Cache

The cache in an EclipseLink application holds objects that have already
been read from or written to the database. Use of the cache in an
EclipseLink application reduces the number of accesses to the database.
Because accessing the database consumes time and resources, an effective
caching strategy is important to the efficiency of your application.

For more information about configuring and using the cache, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)[Introduction to Cache].

=== How to Use In-Memory Queries

An in-memory query is a query that is run against the shared session
cache. Careful configuration of in-memory querying improves performance,
but not all queries benefit from in-memory querying. For example,
queries for individual objects based on primary keys generally see
performance gains from in-memory querying; queries not based on primary
keys are less likely to benefit.By default, queries that look for a
single object based on primary keys attempt to retrieve the required
object from the cache first, and then to search the database if the
object is not in the cache. All other query types search the database
first, by default. You can specify whether a given query runs against
the in-memory cache, the database, or both. In-memory querying lets you
perform queries on the cache rather than the database.

==== Configuring Cache Usage for In-Memory Queries

You can configure in-memory query cache usage at the query level using
`+ReadObjectQuery+` and `+ReadAllQuery+` methods:

* `+checkCacheByPrimaryKey+`: The default setting; if a read-object
query contains an expression that compares at least the primary key, you
can obtain a cache hit if you process the expression against the objects
in memory.
* `+checkCacheByExactPrimaryKey+`: If a read-object query contains an
expression where the primary key is the only comparison, you can obtain
a cache hit if you process the expression against the object in memory.
* `+checkCacheThenDatabase+`: You can configure any read-object query to
check the cache completely before you resort to accessing the database.
* `+checkCacheOnly+`: You can configure any read-all query to check only
the parent session cache (not the unit of work cache) and return the
result from the parent session cache without accessing the database.
* `+conformResultsInUnitOfWork+`: You can configure any read-object or
read-all query within the context of a unit of work to conform the
results with the changes to the object made within that unit of work.
This includes new objects, deleted objects and changed objects. For more
information and limitations on conforming, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)[Using Conforming
Queries and Descriptors].

Alternatively, you can configure cache usage using the
`+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` method `+setCacheUsage+`, passing in the
appropriate `+ObjectLevelReadQuery+` field: `+CheckCacheByPrimaryKey+`,
`+CheckCacheByExactPrimaryKey+`, `+CheckCacheThenDatabase+`,
`+CheckCacheOnly+`, `+ConformResultsInUnitOfWork+`, or
`+DoNotCheckCache+`.

==== Expression Options for In-Memory Queries

You can use a subset of `+Expression+` (see the
link:#Table_104-6[Expressions Operator Support for In-Memory Queries]
table) and `+ExpressionMath+` (see the link:#Table_104-7[ExpressionMath
Operator Support for In-Memory Queries] table) methods with in-memory
queries. For more information about these options, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)[Introduction
to EclipseLink Expressions].

==== Handling Exceptions Resulting from In-Memory Queries

In-memory queries may fail for several reasons, the most common of which
are the following:

* The query expression is too complex to execute in memory.
* There are untriggered value holders in which indirection (lazy
loading) is used. All object models that use indirection must first
trigger value holders before they conform on the relevant objects.

EclipseLink provides a mechanism to handle indirection exceptions. To
specify how the application must handle these exceptions, use the
following `+InMemoryQueryIndirectionPolicy+` methods:

* `+throwIndirectionException+`: The default setting; it is the only
setting that throws indirection exceptions.
* `+triggerIndirection+`: Triggers all valueholders to eliminate the
problem.
* `+ignoreIndirectionExceptionReturnConformed+`: Returns conforming if
an untriggered value holder is encountered. That is, results from the
database are expected to conform, and an untriggered value holder is
taken to mean that the underlying attribute has not changed.
* `+ignoreIndirectionExceptionReturnNotConformed+`: Returns not
conforming if an untriggered value holder is encountered.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: When you build new applications, consider throwing all conform
exceptions. This provides more detailed feedback for unsuccessful
in-memory queries. For more information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)[Handling
Exceptions During Conforming].
|===

=== Primary Key Queries and the Cache

When a query searches for a single object by a primary key, EclipseLink
extracts the primary key from the query and attempts to return the
object from the cache without accessing the database. If the object is
not in the cache, the query executes against the database, builds the
resulting object(s), and places it in the identity map.

If the query is based on a nonprimary key selection criteria or is a
read-all query, the query executes against the database (unless you are
using `+ReadObjectQuery+` or `+ReadAllQuery+` method
`+checkCacheOnly+`). The query matches primary keys from the result set
to objects in the cache, and returns the cached objects, if any, in the
result set.

If an object is not in the cache, EclipseLink builds the object. If the
query is a refreshing query, EclipseLink updates the contents of any
objects with the results from the query. Use "`equals`" on the object
identity to properly configure and use an identity map.

Clients can refresh objects when they want to ensure that they have the
latest data at a particular time.

*Traversing Relationships with Compound Primary Keys*

When getting objects by using compound primary keys to traverse
relationships, you must create use query keys (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)[Query Keys
and Expressions]). By adding a query key for each mapped attribute in a
class with a complex primary key, EclipseLink can use the primary key on
the cache.

Consider the class `+MyClass+` with two attributes: `+A+` and `+B+`.
Both `+A+` and `+B+` are mapped as 1:1 mappings to the database and
designated primary keys.

You should create a query key for each attribute (such as
`+MyQueryKeyA+` and `+MyQueryKeyB+`) that will map the attributes of the
primary key of MyClass _without_ going through the other classes. You
can then use the query key to find the object in the cache and query the
object’s primary key:

`+builder.get("MyQueryKeyA").equal(new Long("123456"));+`

=== How to Disable the Identity Map Cache Update During a Read Query

To disable the identity map cache update, which is normally performed by
a read query, call the `+dontMaintainCache+` method. This improves the
query performance when you read objects that are not needed later by the
application and can avoid exceptions during partial object queries (see
link:Using%20Basic%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Reading Objects Using Partial
Object Queries]).

This example demonstrates how code reads `+Employee+` objects from the
database and writes the information to a file.

[#Example 104-1]## *_Disabling the Identity Map Cache Update_*

*`+//\'\' \'\'Reads\'\' \'\'objects\'\' \'\'from\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'employee\'\' \'\'table\'\' \'\'and\'\' \'\'writes\'\' \'\'them\'\' \'\'to\'\' \'\'an\'\' \'\'employee\'\' \'\'file+`*`+ +`
`+void writeEmployeeTableToFile(String filename, Session session) {+`
`+    Vector employeeObjects;+`
`+    +`*`+//\'\' \'\'Create\'\' \'\'ReadAllQuery\'\' \'\'and\'\' \'\'set\'\' \'\'Employee\'\' \'\'as\'\' \'\'its\'\' \'\'reference\'\' \'\'class+`*
`+    ReadAllQuery query = new ReadAllQuery(Employee.class);+`
`+    ExpressionBuilder builder = query.getExpressionBuilder();+`
`+    query.setSelectionCriteria(builder.get("id").greaterThan(100)); +`
`+    query.dontMaintainCache();+`
`+    Vector employees = (Vector) session.executeQuery(query);+`
`+    +`*`+//\'\' \'\'Write\'\' \'\'all\'\' \'\'the\'\' \'\'employee\'\' \'\'data\'\' \'\'to\'\' \'\'a\'\' \'\'file+`*
`+    Employee.writeToFile(filename, employees);+` `+}+`

=== How to Refresh the Cache

You can refresh objects in the cache to ensure that they are current
with the database, while preserving object identity. This section
describes how to use query API to perform the following:

* Configure query refreshing at the descriptor level (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring Cache
Refreshing]) to apply cache refreshing to all queries of a particular
object type. Before configuring cache refresh options, consider their
effect on performance (see
link:Optimizing%20the%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)[Optimizing
Cache]).

==== Object Refresh

To refresh objects in the cache with the data in the database, call the
`+Session+` method `+refreshObject+` or the `+ReadObjectQuery+` method
`+setShouldRefreshIdentityMapResult(true)+`.

==== Cascading Object Refresh

You can control the depth at which a refreshing updates objects and
their related objects. There are the following three options:

[arabic]
. `+CascadePrivateParts+`: Default refresh behavior. Refreshes the local
level object and objects that are referenced in privately owned
relationships.
. `+CascadeNone+`: Refreshes only the first level of the object, but
does not refresh related objects.
. `+CascadeAll+`: Refreshes the entire object tree, stopping when it
reaches leaf objects.
. `+CascadeMapping+`: Refreshes each mapping that is configured to
cascade refresh

==== Refreshing the Identity Map Cache During a Read Query

Include the `+refreshIdentityMapResult+` method in a query to force
refreshing of an identity map with the results of the query, as the
following example shows:

[#Example 104-2]## *_Refreshing the Result of a Query in the Identity
Map Cache During a Read Query_*

*`+//\'\' \'\'Create\'\' \'\'ReadObjectQuery\'\' \'\'and\'\' \'\'set\'\' \'\'Employee\'\' \'\'as\'\' \'\'its\'\' \'\'reference\'\' \'\'class+`*
`+ReadObjectQuery query = new ReadObjectQuery(Employee.class);+`
`+ExpressionBuilder builder = query.getExpressionBuilder();+`
`+query.setSelectionCriteria(builder.get("lastName").equal("Smith")); +`
`+query.refreshIdentityMapResult();+`
`+Employee employee = (Employee) session.executeQuery(query);+`

The `+refreshIdentityMapResult+` method refreshes the object’s
attributes, but not the attributes of its privately owned parts.
However, under most circumstances, you should refresh an object’s
privately owned parts and other related objects to ensure consistency
with the database.

To refresh privately owned or related parts, use the following methods:

* `+cascadePrivateParts+`: Refreshes all privately owned objects
* `+cascadeAllParts+`: Refreshes all related objects

[#Example 104-3]## *_Using the cascadePrivateParts Method_*

`+ReadAllQuery query = new ReadAllQuery(Employee.class);+`
`+query.refreshIdentityMapResult();+` `+query.cascadePrivateParts();+`
`+Vector employees = (Vector) session.executeQuery(query);+`

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: If the object is in the session cache, you can also use the
`+refreshObject+` method to refresh an object and its privately owned
parts.

=== How to Cache Query Results in the Session Cache

By default, EclipseLink stores query results in the session cache
enabling EclipseLink to execute the query repeatedly, without accessing
the database. This is useful when you execute queries that run against
static data.

By default, a read-all query always goes to the database, as it does not
know how many objects it is seeking. However if the object already
exists in the cache, time can be saved by not having to build a new
object from the row.

For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)[Introduction to Cache].

=== How to Cache Query Results in the Query Cache

In addition to EclipseLink’s object cache, EclipseLink also supports a
query cache. There is the following distinction between the two:

* The _object cache_ indexes objects by their primary key, allowing
primary key queries to obtain cache hits. By using the object cache,
queries that access the data source can avoid the cost of building the
objects and their relationships if the object is already present.
* The _query cache_ is distinct from the object cache. The query cache
is indexed by the query and the query parameters–not the object’s
primary key. This allows for any query executed with the same parameters
to obtain a query cache hit and return the same result set.

By default, a `+ReadQuery+` does not cache its query result set. You
can, however, configure the query to cache its result set. This is
useful for frequently executed queries whose result set infrequently
changes. The query cache always maintains hard references to the result
set; the number of results sets for distinct parameters stored in the
query cache is configurable. The query cache maintains its size number
of the last executed queries with distinct parameters.

For more information, see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How to Cache Results in a
ReadQuery].

You can apply a cache invalidation policy to the query’s internal cache
(see link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[How to Configure Cache
Expiration at the Query Level]). For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)[Cache Invalidation].

==== Internal Query Cache Restrictions

EclipseLink does not support the use of the query cache with cursors: if
you use query caching with cursors, EclipseLink will throw an exception.
For information on cursor query results, see
link:#Stream_and_Cursor_Query_Result[Stream and Cursor Query Resultss]
and link:Using%20Advanced%20Query%20API%20(ELUG)[Handling Cursor and
Stream Query Results].

== Query API

The following table summarizes the query support provided by each type
of session. For each session type, it shows the type of query operation
(create, read, update, delete) that you can perform and whether or not
you can execute a `+DatabaseQuery+` or `+Call+`. For example, using a
unit of work, you can use session queries to read and delete; using a
server session, you can use session queries to create, read, update, and
delete.
