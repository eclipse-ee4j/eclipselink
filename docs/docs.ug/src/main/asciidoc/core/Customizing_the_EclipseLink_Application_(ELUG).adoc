Special:Whatlinkshere_Customizing_the_EclipseLink_Application_(ELUG)[Related
Topics]

There are multiple ways to customize your EclipseLink application,
ranging from creating custom data types to using JPA extensions.

[#Introduction to Customization]####By design, EclipseLink can adapt to
a variety of relational and nonrelational data sources.

To integrate EclipseLink with a data source that is not directly
supported by the EclipseLink API,we recommend that you use an
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Projects%20(ELUG)[EIS project] or a
link:Introduction%20to%20XML%20Projects%20(ELUG)[XML project]).

Using an EIS project, you can integrate your EclipseLink-enabled
application with any nonrelational data source that supports a JCA
adapter and any supported EIS record type, including indexed, mapped, or
XML. If no JCA adapter exists for your target data source, you can
concentrate your integration efforts on creating an adapter.
Simultaneously, you can build your application according to JCA
specifications. Although this still requires custom development effort,
it is more efficient than trying to extend EclipseLink classes and
provides you with a JCA adapter that you can leverage in any other
project (making it a better value).

Using an XML project, you can integrate your EclipseLink-enabled
application with Web services or other XML-message based designs.

The remainder of this chapter describes other customization options
provided by the EclipseLink API.

== Creating Custom Data Types

EclipseLink provides support for all the most common Java data types.
This table lists the EclipseLink mapping extensions that you can use to
support custom data types. You can also create your object converter to
allow conversion between a data type and your own Java type.

[#Table 15-1]## *_Mapping Extensions for Custom Data Types_*

[width="100%",cols="<25%,<75%",options="header",]
|===
|*Extension* |*Description*
|link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Object Type Converter] |An
extension of direct and direct collection mappings that lets you match a
fixed number of data values to Java objects. Use this converter when the
values in the schema differ from those in Java

|link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Serialized Object Converter]
|An extension of direct and direct collection mappings that lets you map
serializable objects, such as multimedia data, to a binary format in a
data source, such as a base64 element in an XML document or Binary Large
Object (BLOB) field in a database

|link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Type Conversion Converter]
|An extension of direct and direct collection mappings that lets you
explicitly map a data source type to a Java type. For example, a
`+java.util.Date+` in Java can be mapped to a `+java.sql.Date+` in the
data source.

|link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[Simple Type Translator] |An
extension of direct and direct collection mappings that lets you
automatically translate an XML element value to an appropriate Java type
based on the element’s attribute as defined in your XML schema.

== Using the Session Customizer Class

You can customize a session at run time by specifying a session
customizer–a Java class that implements the
`+org.eclipse.persistence.config.SessionCustomizer+` interface.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Sessions%20(ELUG)#Session_Customization[Session
Customization]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Session_Customizer_Class[Configuring
a Session Customizer Class]
* Persistence unit property `+eclipselink.session.customizer+` in
link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)#EclipseLink_JPA_Persistence_Unit_Properties_for_Customization_and_Validation[EclipseLink
JPA Persistence Unit Properties for Customization and Validation]

== Using the Descriptor Customizer Class

You can customize a descriptor at run time by specifying a descriptor
customizer–a Java class that implements the
`+org.eclipse.persistence.config.DescriptorCustomizer+` interface.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)#Descriptor_Customization[Descriptor
Customization]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Descriptor_Customizer_Class[Configuring
a Descriptor Customizer Class]
* link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)[How to Use the
@Customizer Annotation]

JPA Persistence Unit Properties for Customization and Validation]

== Using the Descriptor Amendment Methods

To customize descriptors, you can use their amendment methods.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)#Amendment_and_After-Load_Methods[Amendment
and After-Load Methods]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Amendment_Methods[Configuring
Amendment Methods]

== Using EclipseLink JPA Extensions

If you are developing an EclipseLink JPA application, use EclipseLink
JPA metadata annotations and XML extensions for customization.

For more information, see
link:Using%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Extensions%20(ELUG)[Using EclipseLink
JPA Extensions].

== Using Oracle Database Proxy Authentication in JPA Applications

For information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20EclipseLink%20JPA%20Application%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Oracle_Database_Proxy_Authentication_for_a_JPA_Application[Configuring
Oracle Database Proxy Authentication for a JPA Application].
