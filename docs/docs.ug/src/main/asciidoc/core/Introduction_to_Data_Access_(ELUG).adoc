*TOC* Special:Whatlinkshere_Introduction_to_Data_Access_(ELUG)[Related
Topics]

One of the most important functions of a session is to provide access to
a data source.

== Data Access Concepts

This section describes concepts unique to EclipseLink data access.

=== Externally Managed Transactional Data Sources

A EclipseLink transactional data source is _externally managed_ if the
connection pool is managed by a transaction service (such as an
application server controlled transaction or a JTA transaction). A JTA
managed data source or connection pool is commonly used in Java EE
applications and normally required in EJB applications. Use an
externally-managed connection pool as follows:

* Configure the session to use an `+ExternalTransactionController+` to
integrate EclipseLink’s unit of work with the external transaction
service (see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)#Integrating_the_Unit_of_Work_with_an_External_Transaction_Service[Integrating
the Unit of Work with an External Transaction Service]).
* Use the `+external-transaction-control+` option to specify the
connection’s login and inform EclipseLink that the connection is
maintained by the external controller (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Data%20Source%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_External_Connection_Pooling[Configuring
External Connection Pooling]).
* You may need to configure the EclipseLink read connection pool or
sequence connection pool to use a non-JTA connection pool in order to
avoid transactional overhead (see
link:#Default_(Write)_and_Read_Connection_Pools[Default (Write) and Read
Connection Pools]).

For more information on transactional data sources, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Transactions_(ELUG)#JTA_Controlled_Transactions[JTA
Controlled Transactions]
* link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Transactions_(ELUG)#OTS_Controlled_Transactions[OTS
Controlled Transactions]

Refer to
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Transactions_(ELUG)[Introduction
to EclipseLink Transactions] for more information on EclipseLink
transactions.

=== Data Source Login Types

The login (if any) associated with a session determines how the
EclipseLink runtime connects to the project’s data source.

A login includes details of data source access, such as authentication,
use of connection pools, and use of external transaction controllers. A
`+Login+` owns a data source platform.

A data source platform includes options specific to a particular data
source including such as binding, use of native SQL, use of batch
writing, and sequencing. For more information about platforms, see
link:#Data_Source_Platform_Types[Data Source Platform Types].

For projects that do not persist to a data source, a login is not
required. For projects that do persist to a data source, a login is
always required.

In Workbench, the project type determines the type of login that the
project uses, if applicable.

You can use a login in a variety of roles. A login’s role determines
where and how you create it. The login role you choose depends on the
type of project you are creating and how you intend to use the login, as
follows:

* link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#POJO_Session_Role[POJO
Session Role]
* link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#Development_Role[Development
Role]

There is a session login type for each project type that persists to a
data source. The following are the types:

* link:#DatabaseLogin[DatabaseLogin]
* link:#EISLogin[EISLogin]

Note that there is no XML login. EclipseLink XML projects are used for
nonpersistent, in-memory object to XML data transformation and
consequently there is no data source to log in to. For more information
about persistent and nonpersistent projects, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#Persistent_and_Nonpersistent_Projects[Persistent
and Nonpersistent Projects].

For additional information, see the following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#Projects_and_Login[Projects
and Login]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Data%20Source%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Common_Data_Source_Login_Options[Configuring
Common Data Source Login Options]

==== DatabaseLogin

If you are creating a project that accesses a relational database, you
must configure the project with a `+DatabaseLogin+`. Your choice of
`+DatabasePlatform+` further customizes your project for a particular
type of database (see link:#Database_Platforms[Database Platforms]).

For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_Database_Login_Configuration[Introduction
to Database Login Configuration].

==== EISLogin

If you are creating a project that accesses a nonrelational data source
using a JCA adapter, you must configure the project with an
`+EISLogin+`. Your choice of `+EISPlatform+` further customizes your
project for a particular JCA adapter and specifies what record type
EclipseLink uses to exchange data with the EIS (see
link:#EIS_Platforms[EIS Platforms]).

For more information, see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Login%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_EIS_Login_Configuration[Introduction
to EIS Login Configuration].

=== Data Source Platform Types

EclipseLink abstracts the details of your underlying data source using
data source platform classes. EclipseLink provides the following data
source platforms:

* link:#Database_Platforms[Database Platforms]
* link:#EIS_Platforms[EIS Platforms]

A data source platform is owned by your project’s `+Login+`. For more
information about logins, see link:#Data_Source_Login_Types[Data Source
Login Types].

To configure most platform options, you must use an amendment method
(see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Amendment_Methods[Configuring
Amendment Methods]), or a `+preLogin+` event listener (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Sessions%20(ELUG)#Managing_Session_Events_with_the_Session_Event_Manager[Managing
Session Events with the Session Event Manager]).

==== Database Platforms

EclipseLink interacts with databases using structured query language
(SQL). Because each database platform uses its own variation on the
basic SQL language, EclipseLink must adjust the SQL it uses to
communicate with the database to ensure that the application runs
smoothly.

The type of database platform you choose determines the specific means
by which the EclipseLink runtime accesses the database, including the
type of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver to use. JDBC is an
application programming interface (API) that gives Java applications
access to a database. EclipseLink relational projects rely on JDBC
connections to read objects from, and write objects to, the database.
EclipseLink applications use either individual JDBC connections or a
JDBC connection pool (see link:#Connection_Pools[Connection Pools]),
depending on the application architecture.

EclipseLink provides a variety of database-specific platforms that let
you customize your project for your target database.

Oracle Database platforms are located in
`+org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.oracle+` package and include
the following:

* `+OraclePlatform+`
* `+Oracle8Platform+`
* `+Oracle9Platform+`
* `+Oracle10Platform+`
* `+Oracle11Platform+`

Non-Oracle Database platforms are located in
`+org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database+` package and include the
following:

* `+AccessPlatform+` for Microsoft Access databases
* `+AttunityPlatform+` for Attunity Connect JDBC drivers
* `+CloudscapePlatform+`
* `+DB2MainframePlatform+`
* `+DB2Platform+`
* `+DBasePlatform+`
* `+DerbyPlatform+`
* `+HSQLPlatform+`
* `+InformixPlatform+`
* `+JavaDBPlatform+`
* `+MySQLPlatform+`
* `+PointBasePlatform+`
* `+PostgreSQLPlatform+`
* `+SQLAnyWherePlatform+`
* `+SQLServerPlatform+`
* `+SybasePlatform+`
* `+TimesTen7Platform+` for TimesTen 7 database

Specify your database platform at the project level (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Project%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Relational_Database_Platform_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Relational Database Platform at the Project Level]) for all sessions, or
override this project-level configuration at the session level (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Relational_Database_Platform_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
a Relational Database Platform at the Session Level]).

If you set your database platform in Workbench, then Workbench manages
the database platform configuration for you automatically.

==== EIS Platforms

EclipseLink interacts with an EIS data source indirectly by way of a JCA
adapter. EclipseLink abstracts the details of an EIS data source using
the `+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.EISPlatform+` class.

The type of EIS platform you choose determines the specific means by
which the EclipseLink runtime accesses the EIS, including the type of
JCA adapter to use. EclipseLink EIS projects rely on EIS connections to
read objects from, and write objects to, the EIS. EclipseLink
applications use individual EIS connections returned by the EIS
connection factory specified by the EIS platform.

EclipseLink provides a variety of `+EISPlaform+` classes that let you
customize your project for your target EIS.

EIS platforms for production are located in
`+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters+` package and include the
following:

* `+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters.aq.AQPlatform+` to access an
EIS using Oracle Advanced Queuing messages.
* `+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters.attunity.AttunityPlatform+` to
access an EIS using an Attunity JCA adapter.
* `+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters.jms.JMSPlatform+` to access an
EIS using JMS messages.
* `+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters.mqseries.MQPlatform+` to access
an EIS using IBM MQSeries messages.

EIS platforms for testing are also located in
`+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters+` and include the following:

* `+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters.blackbox.BlackBoxPlatform+` for
testing your EIS project with the Sun BlackBox reference adapter using
indexed records only.
* `+org.eclipse.persistence.eis.adapters.xmlfile.XMLFilePlatform+` for
testing your EIS project with an EIS emulated as one or more XML files
in the local file system using XML records.

Specify your EIS platform at the session level (see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_EIS_Data_Source_Platform_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
an EIS Data Source Platform at the Session Level]).

If you set your platform in Workbench, then Workbench manages the EIS
platform configuration for you automatically.

=== Authentication

*Authentication* is the means by which a data source validates a user’s
identity and determines whether or not the user has sufficient
privileges to perform a given action.

For two-tier applications, simple JDBC authentication is usually
sufficient (see link:#Simple_JDBC_Authentication[Simple JDBC
Authentication]).

For three-tier applications, you can use simple JDBC authentication or,
proxy authentication (see
link:#Oracle_Database_Proxy_Authentication[Oracle Database Proxy
Authentication]) when using the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) JDBC driver.

Authentication plays a central role in data security and user
accountability and auditing (see link:#Auditing[Auditing]).

==== Simple JDBC Authentication

When you configure a EclipseLink database login with a user name and
password (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Data%20Source%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_User_Name_and_Password[Configuring
User Name and Password]), EclipseLink provides these credentials to the
JDBC driver that you configure your application to use (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Database_Login_Connection_Options[Configuring
Database Login Connection Options]).

By default, EclipseLink writes passwords to and reads them from the
`+sessions.xml+` file in encrypted form using JCE encryption.
Optionally, you can configure a different encryption class (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Data%20Source%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Password_Encryption[Configuring
Password Encryption]).

==== Oracle Database Proxy Authentication

EclipseLink supports proxy authentication with the Oracle Database in
JSE applications and JEE applications using OC4J native or managed data
sources with Oracle JDBC driver release 10.1.0.2.0 or later and external
connection pools only (see link:#External_Connection_Pools[External
Connection Pools]).

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* EclipseLink does not support Oracle Database proxy
authentication with JTA.
|===

Oracle Database proxy authentication delivers the following security
benefits:

* A limited trust model, by controlling the users on whose behalf middle
tiers can connect, and the roles the middle tiers can assume for the
user.
* Scalability, by supporting user sessions through Oracle Call Interface
(OCI) and thick JDBC, and eliminating the overhead of reauthenticating
clients.
* Accountability, by preserving the identity of the real user through to
the database, and enabling auditing of actions taken on behalf of the
real user.
* Flexibility, by supporting environments in which users are known to
the database, and in which users are merely "`application users`" of
which the database has no awareness.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* Oracle Database supports proxy authentication in three-tiers
only; it does not support it across multiple middle tiers.
|===

For more information about authentication in an Oracle Database, see
"`Preserving User Identity in Multitiered Environments`" in the
_http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/index.html[Oracle
Database Security Guide]_.

Configure your EclipseLink database login to use proxy authentication
(see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Oracle_Database_Proxy_Authentication[Configuring
Oracle Database Proxy Authentication]) to do the following:

* address the complexities of authentication in a three-tier
architecture (such as client-to-middle-tier and middle-tier-to-database
authentication, and client reauthentication through the middle -tier to
the database);
* enhance database audit information (for even triggers and stored
procedures) by using a specific user for database operations, rather
than the generic pool user;
* simplify VPD/OLS configuration (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Sessions%20(ELUG)#Isolated_Client_Sessions_and_Oracle_Virtual_Private_Database_(VPD)[Isolated
Client Sessions and Oracle Virtual Private Database (VPD)]) by using a
proxy user, rather than setting user information directly in the session
context with stored procedures.

==== Auditing

Regardless of what type of authentication you choose, EclipseLink logs
the name of the user associated with all database operations. This
example shows the `+CONFIG+` level EclipseLink logs when a
`+ServerSession+` connects through the main connection for the sample
user "`scott`", and a `+ClientSession+` uses proxy connection "`jeff`".

[#Example 92-1]## *_EclipseLink Logs with Oracle Database Proxy
Authentication_*

`+[EclipseLink Config]--ServerSession(13)--Connection(14)--Thread(Thread[main,5,main])--connecting(DatabaseLogin( platform=>Oracle9Platform   user name=> "scott" connector=>OracleJDBC10_1_0_2ProxyConnector datasource name=>DS))+`
`+[EclipseLink Config]--ServerSession(13)--Connection(34)--Thread(Thread[main,5,main])--Connected: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl+`
`+User: SCOTT+`
`+[EclipseLink Config]--ClientSession(53)--Connection(54)--Thread(Thread[main,5,main])--connecting(DatabaseLogin(platform=>Oracle9Platform user name=> "scott" connector=>OracleJDBC10_1_0_2ProxyConnector datasource name=>DS))+`
`+[EclipseLink Config]--ClientSession(53)--Connection(56)--Thread(Thread[main,5,main])--Connected: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl+`
`+User: jeff+`

For more information on configuring EclipseLink log level and log
options, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Logging[Configuring
Logging].

Your database server likely provides additional user auditing options.
Consult your database server documentation for details.

Alternatively, you may consider using the EclipseLink unit of work in
conjunction with your database schema for auditing purposes (see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)#Implementing_User_and_Date_Auditing_with_the_Unit_of_Work[Implementing
User and Date Auditing with the Unit of Work]).

=== Connections

A connection is an object that provides access to a data source by way
of the driver you configure your application to use (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Database_Login_Connection_Options[Configuring
Database Login Connection Options]). Relational projects use JDBC to
connect to the data source; EIS and XML projects use JCA. EclipseLink
uses the interface
`+org.eclipse.persistence.internal.databaseaccess.Accessor+` to wrap
data source connections. This interface is accessible from certain
events (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)#Descriptor_Event_Manager[Descriptor
Event Manager]).

Typically, when using a server session, EclipseLink uses a a different
connection for both reading and writing. This lets you use
nontransactional connections for reading and avoid maintaining
connections when not required. See
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)#Reading_Through_the_Write_Connection[Reading
Through the Write Connection] and
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Exclusive_Write_Connections[Exclusive
Write Connections] for more information.

By default, a EclipseLink server session acquires connections lazily:
that is, only during the commit operation of a unit of work.
Alternatively, you can configure EclipseLink to acquire a write
connections at the time you acquire a client sessions (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Session%20(ELUG)#Lazy_Connection_Acquisition[Lazy
Connection Acquisition]).

Connections can be allocated from internal or external connection pools
(see link:#Connection_Pools[Connection Pools]).

=== Connection Pools

A *connection pool* is a service that creates and maintains a shared
collection (pool) of data source connections on behalf of one or more
clients. The connection pool provides a connection to a process on
request, and returns the connection to the pool when the process is
finished using it. When it is returned to the pool, the connection is
available for other processes. Because establishing a connection to a
data source can be time-consuming, reusing such connections in a
connection pool can improve performance.

EclipseLink uses connection pools to manage and share the connections
used by server and client sessions. This feature reduces the number of
connections required and allows your application to support many
clients.

You can configure your session to use internal connection pools provided
by EclipseLink or external connection pools provided by a JDBC driver or
Java EE container.

You can use the following connection pools in your EclipseLink
application for a variety of purposes, such as reading, writing,
sequencing, and other application-specific functions:

* link:#Internal_Connection_Pools[Internal Connection Pools]
* link:#External_Connection_Pools[External Connection Pools]
* link:#Default_(Write)_and_Read_Connection_Pools[Default (Write) and
Read Connection Pools]
* link:#Sequence_Connection_Pools[Sequence Connection Pools]
* link:#Application-Specific_Connection_Pools[Application-Specific
Connection Pools]

==== Internal Connection Pools

For non-Java EE applications, you typically use _internal_ connection
pools. By default, EclipseLink sessions use internal connection pools.

Using internal connection pools, you can use Workbench to configure the
default (write) and read connection pools (see
link:#Default_(Write)_and_Read_Connection_Pools[Default (Write) and Read
Connection Pools]) and you can create additional connection pools for
object identity (see link:#Sequence_Connection_Pools[Sequence Connection
Pools]), or any other purpose (see
link:#Application-Specific_Connection_Pools[Application-Specific
Connection Pools]).

Using internal connection pools, you can optimize the creation of read
connections for applications that read data only to display it and only
infrequently modify data (see
link:Configuring%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Nontransactional_Read_Login[Configuring
a Nontransactional Read Login]).

For information on selecting the type of connection pool to use, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Data%20Source%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_External_Connection_Pooling[Configuring
External Connection Pooling].

For more information on creating and configuring internal connection
pools, see the following:

* link:Creating%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_the_Internal_Connection_Pool_Creation[Introduction
to the Internal Connection Pool Creation]
* link:Configuring%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_the_Internal_Connection_Pool_Configuration[Introduction
to the Internal Connection Pool Configuration]

==== External Connection Pools

For Java EE applications, you typically use _external_ connection pools.

If you are using an external transaction controller (JTA), you must use
external connection pools to integrate with the JTA (see
link:Using%20Advanced%20Unit%20of%20Work%20API%20(ELUG)#Integrating_the_Unit_of_Work_with_an_External_Transaction_Service[Integrating
the Unit of Work with an External Transaction Service]).

Using external connection pools, you can use either Workbench or Java to
configure the default (write) and read connection pools (see
link:#Default_(Write)_and_Read_Connection_Pools[Default (Write) and Read
Connection Pools]) and create additional connection pools for object
identity (see link:#Sequence_Connection_Pools[Sequence Connection
Pools]), or any other purpose (see
link:#Application-Specific_Connection_Pools[Application-Specific
Connection Pools]).

For more information on selecting the type of connection pool to use,
see
link:Configuring%20a%20Data%20Source%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_External_Connection_Pooling[Configuring
External Connection Pooling].

==== Default (Write) and Read Connection Pools

A server session provides a read connection pool and a write connection
pool. These could be different pools, or if you use external connection
pooling, the same connection pool.

All read queries use connections from the read connection pool and all
queries that write changes to the data source use connections from the
write connection pool. You can configure attributes of the default read
and write connection pools.

Whenever a new connection is established, EclipseLink uses the
connection configuration you specify in your session’s
`+DatasourceLogin+`. Alternatively, when you use an external transaction
controller, you can define a separate connection configuration for a
read connection pool to avoid the additional overhead, if appropriate
(see
link:Configuring%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Nontransactional_Read_Login[Configuring
a Nontransactional Read Login]).

For more information on configuring read and write connection pools, see
link:Configuring%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_the_Internal_Connection_Pool_Configuration[Introduction
to the Internal Connection Pool Configuration].

==== Sequence Connection Pools

An essential part of maintaining object identity (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Cache%20(ELUG)#Cache_Type_and_Object_Identity[Cache
Type and Object Identity]) is sequencing–managing the assignment of
unique values to distinguish one instance from another. For more
information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#Projects_and_Sequencing[Projects
and Sequencing].

Sequencing involves reading and writing a special sequence resource
maintained by your data source.

By default, EclipseLink includes sequence operations in a separate
transaction. This avoids complications during the write transaction,
which may lead to deadlocks over the sequence resource. However, when
using an external transaction controller (such as a JTA data source or
connection pool), EclipseLink cannot use a different transaction for
sequencing. Use a sequence connection pool to configure a non-JTA
transaction pool for sequencing. This is required only for table
sequencing–not native sequencing.

In each server session, you can create one connection pool, called a
sequence connection pool, that EclipseLink uses exclusively for
sequencing. With a sequence connection pool, EclipseLink satisfies a
request for a new object identifier outside of the transaction from
which the request originates. This allows EclipseLink to immediately
commit an update to the sequence resource, which avoids deadlocks.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: If you use a sequence connection pool and the original
transaction fails, the sequence operation does not roll back.
|===

You should use a sequence connection pool, if the following applies:

* You use table sequencing (that is, non-native sequencing). See
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Table_Sequencing[Table
Sequencing] and
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Unary_Table_Sequencing[Unary
Table Sequencing] for more information.
* You use external transaction controller (JTA).

You should not use a sequence connection pool, if the following applies:

* You do not use sequencing, or use the data source’s native sequencing
(see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Native_Sequencing_with_an_Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with an Oracle Database Platform] and
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Native_Sequencing_with_a_Non-Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with a Non-Oracle Database Platform]).
* You have configured the sequence table to avoid deadlocks.
* You use non-JTA data sources.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Creating%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_the_Internal_Connection_Pool_Creation[Introduction
to the Internal Connection Pool Creation]
* link:Configuring%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_the_Internal_Connection_Pool_Configuration[Introduction
to the Internal Connection Pool Configuration]

==== Application-Specific Connection Pools

When you use internal EclipseLink connection pools in a session, you can
create one or more connection pools that you can use for any application
purpose. These are called named connection pools, as you can give them
any name you want and use them for any purpose.

Typically, use these named connection pools to provide pools of
different security levels. For example, the "`default`" connection pool
may only allow access to specific tables but the "`admin`" connection
pool may allow access to all tables.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Creating%20an%20Internal%20Connection%20Pool%20(ELUG)#Introduction_to_the_Internal_Connection_Pool_Creation[Introduction
to the Internal Connection Pool Creation]
