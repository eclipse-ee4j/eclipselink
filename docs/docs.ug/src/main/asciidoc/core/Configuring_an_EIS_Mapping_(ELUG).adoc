For information on how to create EclipseLink mappings, see
link:Creating%20a%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#CBBHHHJC[Creating a Mapping].

This table lists the types of EIS mappings that you can configure and
provides a cross-reference to the type-specific chapter that lists the
configurable options supported by that type.

== Configuring Common EIS Mapping Options

This table lists the configurable options shared by two or more EIS
mapping types. In addition to the configurable options described here,
you must also configure the options described for the specific EIS
mapping types (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#EIS_Mapping_Types[EIS
Mapping Types]), as shown in the following table.

[#Table 74-2]##

== Configuring Reference Descriptors

In EIS mappings that extend
`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.ForeignReferenceMapping+` or
`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.AggregateMapping+` class, attributes
reference other EclipseLink descriptors–not the data source. You can
select a descriptor in the current project, or a descriptor from some
other project.

This table summarizes which EIS mappings support this option.

=== How to Configure Reference Descriptors Using Workbench

To specify a reference descriptor for an EIS mapping, use this
procedure.

[arabic]
. Select the mapped attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear
in the Editor.
. Click the *General* tab. The General tab appears.
[#Figure 74-1]##*_General Tab, Reference Descriptor Field_*
image:mpgenref.gif[General Tab, Reference Descriptor
Field,title="General Tab, Reference Descriptor Field"]
. Use the *Reference Descriptor* field to select the descriptor
referenced by this relationship mapping.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* For one-to-one and one-to-many EIS mappings, the reference
descriptor must be a root descriptor. See
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_EIS_Descriptor_as_a_Root_or_Composite_Type[Configuring
an EIS Descriptor as a Root or Composite Type].
|===

You can specify a reference descriptor that is not in the current
Workbench project. For example, to create a mapping to an `+Employee+`
class that does not exist in the current project, do the following:

[arabic]
. Add the `+Employee+` class to your current project. See
link:Creating%20a%20Project%20(ELUG)#Working_with_Projects[Working with
Projects].
. Create the relationship mapping to the `+Employee+` descriptor.
. Deactivate the `+Employee+` descriptor. See
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)#Active_and_Inactive_Descriptors[Active
and Inactive Descriptors].

When you generate the deployment XML for your project, the mapping to
the `+Employee+` class will be included, but not the `+Employee+` class
itself.

== Configuring Selection Interaction

In EIS mappings that extend
`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.ForeignReferenceMapping+` class,
EclipseLink uses a selection interaction to acquire the instance of the
target object to which the mapping refers.

By default, EclipseLink uses the read interaction you define for the
mapping’s reference descriptor (see
link:#Configuring_Reference_Descriptors[Configuring Reference
Descriptors]). In most cases, this interaction is sufficient. If the
reference descriptor’s read interaction is not sufficient, you can
define a separate interaction.

This table summarizes which EIS mappings support this option.

For more information about how EclipseLink uses the selection criteria,
see
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Reference_EIS_Mappings[Reference
EIS Mappings].

=== How to Configure Selection Interaction Using Workbench

To specify the selection interaction (such as Read Object) for the EIS
mapping, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the one-to-many EIS mapping in the *Navigator*. Its properties
appear in the Editor.
. Click the *Selection Interaction* tab. The Selection Interaction tab
appears. [#Figure 74-2 ]##*_Selection Interaction Tab_*
image:selinter.gif[Selection Interaction
Tab,title="Selection Interaction Tab"]
. Complete each field on the tab.

Use the following information to enter data in each field on the tab:

Field

Description

Function Name

The name of the EIS function that this call type (Read Object or Read
All) invokes on the EIS.

Input Record Name

The name passed to the JCA adapter when creating the input record.

Input Root Element Name

The root element name to use for the input DOM.

Input Arguments

The query argument name to map to the interaction field or XPath nodes
in the argument record. For example, if you are using XML records, use
this option to map input argument name to the XPath name/first-name.

Output Arguments

The result record field or XPath nodes to map to the correct nodes in
the record used by the descriptor’s mappings. For example, if you are
using XML records, use this option to map the output fname to
name/first-name.

Output arguments are not required if the interaction returns an XML
result that matches the descriptor’s mappings.

Input Result Path

Use this option if the EIS interaction expects the interaction arguments
to be nested in the XML record. For example, specify arguments, if the
arguments were to be nested under the root element exec-find-order, then
under an arguments element.

Output Result Path

The name of the EIS function that this call type (Read Object or Read
All) invokes on the EIS.

Properties

Any properties required by your EIS platform. For example, property name
operation (from AQPlatform.QUEUE_OPERATION) and property value enqueue
(from AQPlatform.ENQUEUE).
