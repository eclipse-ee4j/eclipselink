EclipseLink is an advanced, object-persistence and object-transformation
framework that provides development tools and run-time capabilities that
reduce development and maintenance efforts, and increase enterprise
application functionality.

== What Is EclipseLink?

EclipseLink builds high-performance applications that store persistent
object-oriented data in a relational database. It successfully
transforms object-oriented data into either relational data or
Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements.

*_EclipseLink Runtime Architecture_*

Architecture,title="EclipseLink Runtime Architecture"]

Using EclipseLink, you can integrate persistence and
object-transformation into your application, while staying focused on
your primary domain problem by taking advantage of an efficient,
flexible, and field-proven solution (see
link:#What_Is_the_Object-Persistence_Impedance_Mismatch[What Is the
Object-Persistence Impedance Mismatch]).

EclipseLink is suitable for use with a wide range of Java 2 Enterprise
Edition (Java EE) and Java application architectures (see
link:#EclipseLink_Application_Architectures[EclipseLink Application
Architectures]). Use EclipseLink to design, implement, deploy, and
optimize an advanced, object-persistence and object-transformation layer
that supports a variety of data sources and formats, including the
following:

* Relational–for transactional persistence of Java objects to a
relational database accessed using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
drivers.
* Object-Relational Data Type–for transactional persistence of Java
objects to special purpose structured data source representations
optimized for storage in object-relational data type databases such as
Oracle Database.
* Enterprise information system (EIS)–for transactional persistence of
Java objects to a nonrelational data source accessed using a Java EE
Connector architecture (JCA) adapter, and any supported EIS record type,
including indexed, mapped, or XML.
* XML–for nontransactional, nonpersistent (in-memory) conversion between
Java objects and XML Schema Document (XSD)-based XML documents using
Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB).

EclipseLink includes support for EJB 3.0 and the Java Persistence API
(JPA) in Java EE and Java SE environments including integration with a
variety of application severs including: Oracle WebLogic Server, OC4J,
Glassfish/SunAS, JBoss, and IBM WebSphere application server.
EclipseLink lets you quickly capture and define object-to-data source
and object-to-data representation mappings in a flexible, efficient
metadata format (see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Working_with_EclipseLink_Metadata[Working
with EclipseLink Metadata]).

The EclipseLink runtime lets your application exploit this mapping
metadata with a simple session facade that provides in-depth support for
data access, queries, transactions (both with and without an external
transaction controller), and caching.

For more information, see link:#EclipseLink_Key_Features[EclipseLink Key
Features].

== What Is the Object-Persistence Impedance Mismatch

Java-to-data source integration is a widely underestimated problem when
creating enterprise Java applications. This complex problem involves
more than simply reading from and writing to a data source. The data
source elements include tables, rows, columns, and primary and foreign
keys. The Java and Java EE include entity classes (regular Java classes
or Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) entity beans), business rules, complex
relationships, and inheritance. In a nonrelational data source, you must
match your Java entities with EIS records or XML elements and schemas.
These differences (as shown in the following figure) are known as the
object-persistence impedance mismatch.

*_Solving Object-Persistence Impedance Mismatch_*

.Solving Object-Persistence Impedance Mismatch
image::mismatch.gif[Solving Object-Persistence Impedance
Mismatch,title="Solving Object-Persistence Impedance Mismatch"]

Successful solution requires bridging these different technologies, and
solving the object-persistence impedance mismatch–a challenging and
resource-intensive problem. To solve this problem, you must resolve the
following issues between Java EE and data source elements:

* Fundamentally different technologies.
* Different skill sets.
* Different staff and ownership for each of the technologies.
* Different modeling and design principles.

As an application developer, you need a product that lets integrate Java
applications with any data source, without compromising ideal
application design or data integrity. In addition, as a Java developer,
you need the ability to store (that is, *persist*) and retrieve business
domain objects using a relational database or a nonrelational data
source as a repository.

=== EclipseLink Solution

EclipseLink addresses the disparity between Java objects and data
sources. EclipseLink is a persistence framework that manages relational,
object-relational data type, EIS, and XML mappings in a seamless manner.
This lets you rapidly build applications that combine the best aspects
of object technology and the specific data source. EclipseLink lets you
do the following:

* Persist Java objects to virtually _any_ relational database supported
by a JDBC-compliant driver.
* Persist Java objects to virtually _any_ nonrelational data source
supported by a Java EE Connector architecture (JCA) adapter using
indexed, mapped, or XML enterprise information system (EIS) records.
* Perform in-memory conversions between Java objects and XML Schema
(XSD) based XML documents using JAXB.
* Map _any_ object model to _any_ relational or nonrelational schema,
using the Workbench graphical mapping tool or Oracle JDeveloper
EclipseLink editor.
* Use EclipseLink successfully, even if you are unfamiliar with SQL or
JDBC, because EclipseLink offers a clear, object-oriented view of data
sources.

== EclipseLink Key Features

EclipseLink provides an extensive and thorough set of features. You can
use these features to rapidly build high-performance enterprise
applications that are both scalable and maintainable.

Some of the primary features of EclipseLink are the following:

* Nonintrusive, flexible, metadata-based architecture (see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Working_with_EclipseLink_Metadata[Working
with EclipseLink Metadata])
* Architectural flexibility: Java Persistence API (JPA), Plain Old Java
Objects (POJO), Java API for XML Binding (JAXB), and Web services.
* Advanced mapping support and flexibility: relational,
object-relational data type, Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), and
XML.
* Optimized for highly scalable performance and concurrency with
extensive performance tuning options.
* Comprehensive object caching support including cluster integration.
* Extensive query capability including: EclipseLink Expressions
framework, Java Persistence Query Language (JP QL), and native SQL.
* Just-in-time reading
* Object-level transaction support and integration with popular
application servers and databases.
* Optimistic and pessimistic locking options and locking policies.
* Comprehensive visual design tools.

== EclipseLink Application Architectures

You can use EclipseLink in a variety of application architectures,
including three- and two-tier architectures, with or without Java EE, to
access a variety of data types on both relational and nonrelational data
sources.

*_EclipseLink and Your Application Architecture_*

.EclipseLink and Your Application Architecture

Architecture,title="EclipseLink and Your Application Architecture"]

For more information on strategies for incorporating EclipseLink into
your application architecture, see
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Designing_Your_Application_with_EclipseLink[Designing
Your Application with EclipseLink].

This section introduces some of the following common enterprise
architectures used by EclipseLink applications:

* *Three-Tier* – The three-tier (or Java EE Web) application is one of
the most common EclipseLink architectures. This architecture is
characterized by a server-hosted environment in which the business
logic, persistent entities, and the EclipseLink Foundation Library all
exist in a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM). See
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Considering_Three-Tier_Architecture[Considering
Three-Tier Architecture] for more information. The most common example
of this architecture is a simple three-tier application in which the
client browser accesses the application through servlets, JavaServer
Pages (JSP) and HTML. The presentation layer communicates with
EclipseLink through other Java classes in the same JVM, to provide the
necessary persistence logic. This architecture supports multiple servers
in a clustered environment, but there is no separation across JVMs from
the presentation layer and the code that invokes the persistence logic
against the persistent entities using EclipseLink.
* *EJB Session Bean Facade*– A popular variation on the three-tier
application involves wrapping the business logic, including the
EclipseLink access, in EJB session beans. This architecture provides a
scalable deployment and includes integration with transaction services
from the host application server. See
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Considering_EJB_Session_Bean_Facade_Architecture[Considering
EJB Session Bean Facade Architecture] for more information.
Communication from the presentation layer occurs through calls to the
EJB session beans. This architecture separates the application into
different tiers for the deployment. The session bean architecture can
persist either Java objects or EJB entity beans.
* *EJB 3.0 Entities with JPA* – The EJB 3.0 specification includes an
additional persistence specification called the Java Persistence API
(JPA). You can use this API for creating, reading, updating, and
deleting plain old Java objects (POJO) within both a compliant EJB 3.0
Java EE container and a standard Java SE 5 (or later) environment.
EclipseLink JPA is a standards compliant JPA persistence provider built
on the EclipseLink foundation library. EclipseLink JPA offers a variety
of vendor extensions (annotations and persistence properties) that give
you full access to the underlying EclipseLink API. For more information,
see:

JPA Entity Architecture]

* *Web Services* – A Web services architecture is similar to the
three-tier or session-bean architecture. However, in a Web services
architecture you encapsulate business logic (the service) in a Web
service instead of (or in addition to) using session beans. In a Web
services architecture, clients communicate with your application using
XML. As in any architecture, you can use EclipseLink to persist objects
to relational or EIS data sources. However, in a Web services
architecture you can also use EclipseLink to map your object model to an
XML schema for use with the Web service or as the Web service XML
serializer. See
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Considering_Web_Services_Architecture[Considering
Web Services Architecture] for more information
* *EclipseLink Database Web Services* – EclipseLink database Web
services architecture (introduced in 1.1) is similar to the Web services
architecture. However, in an EclipseLink database Web services
architecture, you use EclipseLink to automatically generate Web services
that expose database operations such as queries, DML statements, and
stored procedures and stored functions. Using EclipseLink database Web
services, you can provide Java EE compliant, client-neutral access to a
relational database without having to write Java code. As in any Web
services architecture, clients communicate with your application using
SOAP (XML) messages. However, in an EclipseLink database Web services
architecture you need only specify an XSD for persistent classes.
Clients need only invoke the operations the EclipseLink database Web
service exposes to create, read, update, and delete these persistent
objects. EclipseLink database Web services return objects or row set
data, depending on the type of operation. See
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Considering_EclipseLink_Database_Web_Service_Architecture[Considering
EclipseLink Database Web Service Architecture] for more information.
* *Two-Tier* – A two-tier (or client/server) application is one in which
the EclipseLink application accesses the database directly. Although
less common than the other architectures discussed here, EclipseLink
supports this architecture for smaller or embedded data processing
applications. See
link:Introduction_to_EclipseLink_Application_Development_(ELUG)#Considering_Two-Tier_Architecture[Considering
Two-Tier Architecture] for more information.
