== Configuring a Database Field

You can associate an object attribute with a database field.

This table summarizes which relational mappings support this option.

Mapping] |image:support.gif[Supported.,title="Supported."]
|image:support.gif[Supported.,title="Supported."]
|===

When choosing the database field, you must consider Java and database
field type compatibility.

EclipseLink supports the following Java types:

* `+java.lang+`: `+Boolean+`, `+Float+`, `+Integer+`, `+String+`,
`+Double+`, `+Long+`, `+Short+`, `+Byte+`, `+Byte[ ]+`, `+Character+`,
`+Character[ ]+`; all the primitives associated with these classes
* `+java.math+`: `+BigInteger+`, `+BigDecimal+`
* `+java.sql+`: `+Date+`, `+Time+`, `+Timestamp+`
* `+java.util+`: `+Date+`, `+Calendar+`

While executing reads, the mappings in the link:#Table_33-6[Relational
Mapping Support for Reference Descriptor] table perform the simple
one-way data conversions that the link:#Table_33-4[Type Conversions
Provided by Direct-to-Field Mappings] table describes. For two-way or
more complex conversions, You must
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Converters_and_Transformers[use
converters]).

The mappings in this table also allow you to specify a null value. This
may be required if primitive types are used in the object, and the
database field allows `+null+` values. For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Mapping%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Default_Null_Value_at_the_Mapping_Level[Configuring
a Default Null Value at the Mapping Level].

*Support for oracle.sql.TimeStamp*

EclipseLink provides additional support for mapping Java date and time
data types to Oracle Database `+DATE+`, `+TIMESTAMP+`, and
`+TIMESTAMPTZ+` data types when you use the Oracle JDBC driver with
Oracle9__i__ Database Server or later and the `+Oracle9Platform+` in
EclipseLink.

In a direct-to-field mapping, you are not required to specify the
database type of the field value; EclipseLink determines the appropriate
data type conversion.

This table lists the supported direct-to-field mapping combinations.

*_Supported Oracle Database Date and Time Direct-to-Field Mappings_*

TIMESTAMPTZ

Full bidirectional support.

DATE

Milliseconds are not stored in the database.

java.util.Calendar

TIMESTAMP

Native SQL or binding gives Calendar timezone.

Note: The TIMESTAMP database value has no timezone – the Calendar object
provides the local timezone by default. If the database is not in this
timezone, you must obtain the database timezone by some other means and
update the Calendarobject accordingly. For this reason, TIMESTAMPTZ may
be a better choice.

TIMESTAMPTZ

Native SQL or binding stores timezone; standard SQL is based on the
local timezone.

DATE

Neither timezone nor milliseconds are stored in the database.

Note that some of these mappings result in a loss of precision: avoid
these combinations if you require this level of precision. For example,
if you create a direct-to-field mapping between a `+java.sql.Date+`
attribute and a `+TIMESTAMPTZ+` database field, there is no loss of
precision. However, if you create a direct-to-field mapping between a
`+java.sql.Timestamp+` attribute and a `+DATE+` database field, the
nanoseconds or milliseconds of the attribute are not stored in the
database.

=== How to Configure a Database Field Using Workbench

Use this procedure to select a specific database field for a direct
mapping.

[arabic]
. Select the direct mapping attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties
appear in the Editor.
. Click the *General* tab. The General tab appears. *_Direct Mapping
General Tab, Database Field Option_* image:mpdtfdfd.gif[Direct Mapping
General Tab, Database Field
Option,title="Direct Mapping General Tab, Database Field Option"]
. Use the *Database Field* field to select a field for this direct
mapping. You must have previously associated the descriptor with a
database table as described in
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Associated_Tables[Configuring
Associated Tables].

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: For direct-to-field mappings of an aggregate descriptor (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring a
Relational Descriptor as a Class or Aggregate Type]), this field is for
display only and cannot be changed.
|===

== Configuring Reference Descriptor

In relational mappings that extend
`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.ForeignReferenceMapping+`, attributes
reference other EclipseLink descriptors–not the data source. You can
select any descriptor in the project.

This table summarizes which relational mappings support this option.

=== How to Configure a Reference Descriptor Using Workbench

To specify a reference descriptor for a relational mapping, use this
procedure.

[arabic]
. Select the mapped attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear
in the Editor.
. Click the *General* tab. The General tab appears. *_General Tab,
Reference Descriptor Field_* image:mpgenref.gif[General Tab, Reference
Descriptor Field,title="General Tab, Reference Descriptor Field"]
. Use the *Reference Descriptor* field to select the descriptor
referenced by this relationship mapping.

Note: For aggregate mappings the Reference Descriptor must be an
aggregate. See Configuring a Relational Descriptor as a Class or
Aggregate Type for more information.

For variable one-to-one mappings, the Reference Descriptor must be an
interface. See Configuring a Relational Variable One-to-One Mapping for
more information.

You can specify a reference descriptor that is not in the current
Workbench project. For example, to create a mapping to an `+Employee+`
class that does not exist in the current project, do the following:

[arabic]
. Add the `+Employee+` class to your current project. See
link:Creating%20a%20Project%20(ELUG)[Working with Projects].
. Create the relationship mapping to the `+Employee+` descriptor.
. Deactivate the `+Employee+` descriptor. See
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)[Active and Inactive Descriptors].

When you generate the deployment XML for your project, the _mapping_ to
the `+Employee+` class will be included, but not the `+Employee+` class.

== Configuring Batch Reading

Batch reading can be used in most of the relational mappings. This
feature should be used only if it is known that the related objects are
always required with the source object.

=== How to Configure Batch Reading Using Workbench

To use batch reading in a relationship mapping, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the mapped attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear
in the Editor.
. Click the *General* tab. The General tab appears. *_General Tab, Batch
Reading Option_* image:oogenbat.gif[General Tab, Batch Reading
Option,title="General Tab, Batch Reading Option"]
. To specify that this mapping using batch reading, select the *Batch
Reading* option.

=== How to Configure Batch Reading Using Java

This example shows how to use a `+DescriptorCustomizer+` class to add
batch reading to a mapping.

[#Example 33-1]## *_Query Optimization Using Batching_*

[arabic]
. Select the mapped attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear
in the Editor.
. Click the *Ordering* tab. The Ordering tab appears. *_Ordering Tab_*
image:onetomany_coll_ord.gif[Ordering Tab,title="Ordering Tab"]
. Complete the *Ordering* options on the tab.

Field

Description

Click Add to add query keys to, or Remove to remove query keys from the
ordering operation.

Click Up or Down to change the sort order of selected query keys.

Order

Specify if EclipseLink orders the selected query key in Ascending or
Descending (alphabetical) order.

=== How to Configure Query Key Order Using Java

This example shows how to use the `+DescriptorCustomizer+` class to add
complex ordering to a mapping.

[#'Example 33-2]## *_Configuring Query Key Order_*

[source,java]
----
 public void customize(ClassDescriptor descriptor) {

     OneToManyMapping phoneNumbersMapping = new OneToManyMapping();

     phoneNumbersMapping = (OneToManyMapping)descriptor.getMappingForAttributeName("phones");

     phoneNumbersMapping.addAscendingOrdering("areaCode");

     ExpressionBuilder phone = phoneNumbersMapping.getSelectionQuery().getExpressionBuilder();

     phoneNumbersMapping.getSelectionQuery().addOrdering(
         phone.get("type").toUpperCase().ascending());
 }
----

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note:* You can provide the same functionality by using a descriptor
amendment method (see
link:Customizing%20the%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)#Using_the_Descriptor_Amendment_Methods[Using
the Descriptor Amendment Methods]).
|===

== Configuring Table and Field References (Foreign and Target Foreign Keys)

A foreign key is a combination of one or more database columns that
reference a unique key, usually the primary key, in another table.
Foreign keys can be any number of fields (similar to a primary key), all
of which are treated as a unit. A foreign key and the parent key it
references must have the same number and type of fields.

Mappings that extend
`+org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.ForeignReferenceMapping+` use foreign
keys to find information in the database so that the target object(s)
can be instantiated. For example, if every `+Employee+` has an attribute
`+address+` that contains an instance of `+Address+` (which has its own
descriptor and table) then, the one-to-one mapping for the `+address+`
attribute would specify foreign key information to find an `+Address+`
for a particular `+Employee+`.

EclipseLink classifies foreign keys into two categories in
mappings–*foreign keys* and *target foreign keys*:

* In a _foreign key,_ the key is found in the table associated with the
mapping’s own descriptor. For example, an `+Employee+` foreign key to
`+ADDRESS+` would be in the `+EMPLOYEE+` table.
* In a _target foreign key_, the reference is from the target object’s
table back to the key from the mapping’s descriptor’s table. For
example, the `+ADDRESS+` table would have a foreign key to `+EMPLOYEE+`.

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Caution*: Make sure you fully understand the distinction between
_foreign key_ and _target foreign key_ before defining a mapping.
|===

The table reference is the database table that contains the foreign key
references.

This table summarizes which relational mappings support this option.

|===

Using Workbench, you can either import this table from your database or
create it. If you import tables from the database (see
link:Using%20Workbench%20(ELUG)[Importing Tables from a Database]),
EclipseLink creates references that correspond to existing database
constraints (if supported by the driver). You can also define references
in EclipseLink without creating similar constraints on the database.

=== How to Configure Table and Field References (Foreign and Target Foreign Keys) Using Workbench

To specify a table for a mapping reference, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the mapped attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear
in the Editor.
. Click the *Table Reference* tab. The Reference tab appears. *_Table
Reference Tab, Table Reference Field_* image:onetomany_tab_ref.gif[Table
Reference Tab, Table Reference
Field,title="Table Reference Tab, Table Reference Field"]
. Complete the fields on the Table Reference tab.

Use the following information to select the field references on the tab:

[width="100%",cols="<16%,<84%",options="header",]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Table Reference* |Select an existing table, or click *New* to create a
new table reference.

|*Source and Target Field* |Click *Add* to create new foreign key
reference. To delete an existing key pair reference, select the *Source*
and *Target* fields and click *Remove*.

|*Source Field* |Select the database field from the _source_ table for
this foreign key reference.

|*Target Field* |Select the database field from the _target_ table for
this foreign key reference.

|*Target Foreign Key* |Specify whether or not the reference is from the
target object’s table back to the key from the mapping’s descriptor’s
table.

the field name of the target foreign key and the source of the primary
key in the source table) to specify foreign key information.

For composite source primary keys, use the
`+addTargetForeignKeyFieldName+` method for each of the fields that
comprise the primary key.

This esxample shows how to use the `+DescriptorCustomizer+` class to add
complex join to a mapping.

[#Example 33-3]## *_Adding Complex Join to a Mapping_*

[source,java]
----
 public void customize(ClassDescriptor descriptor) {

     OneToManyMapping phoneNumbersMapping = new OneToManyMapping();
     phoneNumbersMapping = (OneToManyMapping)descriptor.getMappingForAttributeName("cellPhones");

     ExpressionBuilder phone =  phoneNumbersMapping.getSelectionQuery().getExpressionBuilder();

     phoneNumbersMapping.addTargetForeignKeyFieldName("PHONE.EMP_ID", "EMP.ID");

     phoneNumbersMapping.getSelectionQuery(
         phone.getField("PHONE.EMP_ID").equal(phone.getParameter("EMP.ID").
         and(phone.getField("PHONE.TYPE').equal("CELL")));
 }

== Configuring Joining at the Mapping Level

EclipseLink supports configuring an inner or outer join at the mapping
level for a `+ForeignReferenceMapping+`. When a class that owns the
mapping is read, the EclipseLink runtime will always get the class and
the target of the reference mapping with one database hit.

Use this feature only if the target object is _always_ required with the
source object, or when indirection (lazy loading) is _not_ used. For
more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Indirection_(Lazy_Loading)[Indirection
(Lazy Loading)].

You can also configure join reading at the query level. For more
information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Queries%20(ELUG)#Join_Reading_and_Object-Level_Read_Queries[Join
Reading and Object-Level Read Queries].

For more information about joins, see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Expressions%20(ELUG)[Expressions
for Joining and Complex Relationships].

=== How to Configure Joining at the Mapping Level Using Workbench

To use joining in a relationship mapping, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the mapped attribute in the *Navigator*. Its properties appear
in the Editor.
. Click the *General* tab. The General tab appears.
[#'Figure 33-6]##*_General Tab, Use Joining Option_*

Option,title="General Tab, Use Joining Option"]
. To use joining with this relationship, select the *Use Joining*
option.
