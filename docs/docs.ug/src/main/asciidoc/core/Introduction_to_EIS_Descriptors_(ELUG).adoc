This section introduces options specific to an EIS descriptor.

For information on descriptor concepts and features common to more than
one type of EclipseLink descriptors, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)[Introduction to
Descriptors].

== EIS Descriptor Concepts

EIS descriptors describe Java objects that you map to an EIS data source
by way of a JCA adapter.

Using EIS descriptors in an EIS project created with Workbench, you can
configure EIS mappings (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Mappings%20(ELUG)[EIS Mapping Types]) to
XML records.

Using EIS descriptors in an EIS project that you create in Java, you can
configure EIS mappings to any supported EIS record type: XML, mapped, or
indexed.

See link:Creating_and_Configuring_Descriptors_(ELUG)[Creation and
Configuration of Descriptors] for information on how to create and
configure descriptors regardless of their type.

For information specific to creation and configuration of EIS
descriptors, see the following:

* link:Creating%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Creating an EIS
Descriptor]
* link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)[Configuring an EIS
Descriptor]

== EIS Descriptors and Aggregation

When working with descriptors for a parent (source) and a child (target)
objects, you have to accomplish the following:

* if the source object exists, then you must ensure that the target
object also exists;
* if the source object is destroyed, then you must ensure that the
target object is also destroyed.

For more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)#Descriptors_and_Aggregation[Descriptors
and Aggregation].

In your EIS project, designate the descriptors for the source and target
objects to reflect this relationship as
link:#Root_and_Composite_Descriptors_in_EIS_Projects[Root and Composite
Descriptors in EIS Projects].

=== Root and Composite Descriptors in EIS Projects

In an EIS project, you can designate the descriptor as a composites (see
link:Creating%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#EIS_Composite_Descriptors[EIS
Composite Descriptors]).

The type of EIS mapping you whish to create will determine whether you
configure an EIS descriptor as a composite or root (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EIS%20Mappings%20(ELUG)#Composite_and_Reference_EIS_Mappings[Composite
and Reference EIS Mappings]).

For more information, see
link:Configuring%20an%20EIS%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_an_EIS_Descriptor_as_a_Root_or_Composite_Type[Configuring
an EIS Descriptor as a Root or Composite Type].

You can configure inheritance for an EIS descriptor designated as a
composite (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)#Descriptors_and_Inheritance[Descriptors
and Inheritance]), however, in this case, _all_ the descriptors in the
inheritance tree must be composites. Composite and root descriptors
cannot exist in the same inheritance tree.

== EIS Descriptors and Inheritance

You can use descriptors to describe the inheritance relationships
between classes in your EIS project. For more information, see the
following:

* link:Introduction%20to%20Descriptors%20(ELUG)#Descriptors_and_Inheritance[Descriptors
and Inheritance]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Inheritance_for_a_Child_(Branch_or_Leaf)_Class_Descriptor[Configuring
Inheritance for a Child (Branch or Leaf) Class Descriptor]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Inheritance_for_a_Parent_(Root)_Descriptor[Configuring
Inheritance for a Parent (Root) Descriptor]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Inheritance_Expressions_for_a_Parent_(Root)_Class_Descriptor[Configuring
Inheritance Expressions for a Parent (Root) Class Descriptor]
* link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Inherited_Attribute_Mapping_in_a_Subclass[Configuring
Inherited Attribute Mapping in a Subclass]

=== Inheritance and Primary Keys in EIS Projects

For EIS projects, EclipseLink assumes that all of the classes in an
inheritance hierarchy have the same primary key, as set in the root
descriptor. Child descriptors associated with data source
representations that have different primary keys must define the mapping
between the root primary key and the local one.

For more information, see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Primary_Keys[Configuring
Primary Keys].
