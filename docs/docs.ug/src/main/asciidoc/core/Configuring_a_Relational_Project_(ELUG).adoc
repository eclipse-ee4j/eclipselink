Relational Projects].

== Configuring Relational Database Platform at the Project Level

For each relational project, you must specify the database platform
(such as Oracle Database 10__g__). This platform configuration is
overridden by the session login, if configured.

For more information, see the following:

* link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_a_Relational_Database_Platform_at_the_Session_Level[Configuring
a Relational Database Platform at the Session Level]
* link:Introduction%20to%20Data%20Access%20(ELUG)#Data_Source_Platform_Types[Data
Source Platform Types]

=== How to Configure Relational Database Platform at the Project Level Using Workbench

To specify the database platform of a relational project, use this
procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the database object in the *Navigator*. The Database property
sheet appears. *_Database Property Sheet, Database Platform Options_*
image:dbplat.gif[Database Property Sheet, Database Platform
Options,title="Database Property Sheet, Database Platform Options"]
. Complete the Database Platform option on the property sheet.
. Click *Change* to select a new database platform for the project. For
more information, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Data%20Access%20(ELUG)#Data_Source_Platform_Types[Data
Source Platform Types].

== Configuring Sequencing at the Project Level

Sequencing allows EclipseLink to automatically assign the primary key or
ID of an object when the object is inserted.

You configure EclipseLink sequencing at the project or session level to
tell EclipseLink how to obtain sequence values: that is, what type of
sequences to use.

In a POJO project, you can configure a session directly: in this case,
you can use a session-level sequence configuration to override
project-level sequence configuration, on a
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Session_Level[session-by-session
basis]), if required (see .

link:#How_to_Configure_Sequencing_at_the_Project_Level_Using_Workbench[Using
the Workbench], you can configure
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Table_Sequencing[Table
Sequencing] and native sequencing (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Native_Sequencing_with_an_Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with an Oracle Database Platform] and
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Native_Sequencing_with_a_Non-Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with a Non-Oracle Database Platform]), and you can configure
a preallocation size that applies to all sequences (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Sequencing_and_Preallocation_Size[Sequencing
and Preallocation Size]).

link:#How_to_Configure_Sequencing_at_the_Project_Level_Using_Java[Using
Java], you can configure any sequence type that EclipseLink supports
(see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Sequencing_Types[Sequencing
Types]). You can create any number and combination of sequences. You can
create a sequence object explicitly or use the default sequence that the
platform creates. You can associate the same sequence with more than one
descriptor and you can configure a separate preallocation size for each
descriptor’s sequence.

After configuring the sequence type at the project (or session) level,
to enable sequencing, you must
link:Configuring%20a%20Relational%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Sequencing_at_the_Descriptor_Level[configure
a descriptor with a sequence field and a sequence name].

For more information about sequencing, see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Sequencing_in_Relational_Projects[Sequencing
in Relational Projects].

=== How to Configure Sequencing at the Project Level Using Workbench

To specify the sequencing information for the project, use this
procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the project object in the *Navigator*.
. Select the *Sequencing* tab in the *Editor*. The Sequencing tab
appears. *_Sequencing Tab_* image:sequence.gif[Sequencing
Tab,title="Sequencing Tab"]
. Complete each field on Sequencing tab.

Use this table to enter data in the following fields to configure the
sequencing information:

[width="100%",cols="<6%,<94%",options="header",]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Preallocation Size* |Specify the default preallocation size (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)[Sequencing and
Preallocation Size]). Default is *50*. The preallocation size you
configure applies to all sequences.

|*Default Sequence Table* |Select this option to use table sequencing
(see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Table_Sequencing[Table
Sequencing]) with default sequence table name `+SEQUENCE+`, default
sequence name field `+SEQ_NAME+`, and default sequence counter field
`+SEQ_COUNT+`.

|*Native Sequencing* |Select this option to use a sequencing object (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Native_Sequencing_with_an_Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with an Oracle Database Platform] or
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Native_Sequencing_with_a_Non-Oracle_Database_Platform[Native
Sequencing with a Non-Oracle Database Platform]) created by the database
platform. This option applies only to Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL, and
IBM Informix database platforms.

|*Custom Sequence Table* |Select this option to use table sequencing
(see
link:Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Projects%20(ELUG)#Table_Sequencing[Table
Sequencing]) with a sequence table name, sequence name field, and
sequence counter field name that you specify.

|*Name* |Specify the name of the sequence table.

|*Name Field* |Specify the name of the column used to store the sequence
name.

|*Counter Field* |Specify the name of the column used to store the
sequence count.
|===

=== How to Configure Sequencing at the Project Level Using Java

Using Java, you can configure a project to use multiple, different
sequences, as this exmaple shows.

[#Example 25-1]## *_Configuring Sequencing at the Project Level in
Java_*

[source,java]
----
 // Enable native sequencing for the project as the default. Configured the default
 // preallocation size'''
 project.getLogin().useNativeSequencing();
 project.getLogin().setSequencePreallocationSize(50);

 // Configure the EMP_SEQ to not use preallocation
 DefaultSequence empSequence = new DefaultSequence("EMP_SEQ", 1);
 project.getLogin().addSequence(empSequence);

 // Configure the PROJ_SEQ to use a seperate sequence table
 UnarySequence projSequence = new UnarySequence("PROJ_SEQ_TAB", "COUNTER");
 project.getLogin().addSequence(projSequence);
----

== Configuring Login Information at the Project Level

This section describes how to define a login to a relational database.
After you define a login, you must
link:#Configuring_Development_and_Deployment_Logins[designate its role].

After you
link:#Configuring_Login_Information_at_the_Project_Level[create a login]
and specify it as a
link:#Configuring_Development_and_Deployment_Logins[development login],
you can link:#Logging_In_to_the_Database[log in to a database instance].

=== How to Configure Login Information at the Project Level UsingWorkbench

To create or edit a database login, use this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the database object in the *Navigator*. The Database property
sheet appears. *_Database Property Sheet, Database Login Fields_*
image:dbdefine.gif[Database Property Sheet, Database Login
Fields,title="Database Property Sheet, Database Login Fields"]
. Click *Add* to create a new Defined Login.
. Complete the Database Login fields on the property sheet.

Use this table to enter data in the following fields on the Database
property sheet to configure the database login:

Field

Description

Defined Logins

Login used to access the database. Click Add to add a new login, or
Remove to delete an existing login.

Driver Class

The JDBC driver to use to connect to the database.

URL

The URL used to connect to the appropriate database.

User Name

The name required to log in to the database.

Password

The password required to log in to the database.

Save Password

Whether or not to save the Password for this Defined Login.

We recommend that you do not save the password with a deployment login.

Note: If you select Save Password, then when you export Java source and
deployment XML, Workbench writes the database password using JCE
encryption (when using JDK 1.4 or later). For information on how to
specify password encryption options, see Configuring Password
Encryption.

Default: unselected.

Development and Deployment Logins]

== Configuring Development and Deployment Logins

This section describes how to designate a defined login’s role. For
information on how to define a login, see
link:#Configuring_Login_Information_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Login Information at the Project Level]. EclipseLink recognizes the
following login roles:

* link:#Development_Role[Development Role]
* link:#POJO_Session_Role[POJO Session Role]

*Development Role*

While using Workbench to develop a project (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#Development_Role[Development
Role]), you must define a login (see
link:#Configuring_Login_Information_at_the_Project_Level[Configuring
Login Information at the Project Level]) and designate it as the
development login. The development login is stored in the EclipseLink
project file. Workbench use the information in the development login
whenever you perform a data source operation from within Workbench. For
example, when you read or write schema information from or to a data
source during application development, the development login information
is never written to a `+sessions.xml+` or `+project.xml+` file and is
overridden by the deployment login (or the session login) at run time.

For more information on how to use a development login to connect to a
database, see link:#Logging_In_to_the_Database[Logging In to the
Database].

*POJO Session Role*

If you are creating a
link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#POJO_Session_Role[POJO
project], we recommend that you use the `+sessions.xml+` file to store
the sessions your project uses at run time (see
link:Introduction%20to%20Data%20Access%20(ELUG)#Data_Source_Login_Types[Data
Source Login Types]).

=== How to Configure Development and Deployment Logins Using Workbench

To specify different development and deployment database logins, use
this procedure:

[arabic]
. Select the database object in the *Navigator*. The Database property
sheet appears. *_Database Property Sheet, Development and Deployment
Login Options_* image:dblogins.gif[Database Property Sheet, Development
and Deployment Login
Options,title="Database Property Sheet, Development and Deployment Login Options"]
. Complete the Development and Deployment Login options on the property
sheet by selecting from the logins you configured previously.

Use this table to enter data in the following fields on the Database
property sheet to configure the login:

Field

Description

Development Login

The Defined Login to be used by Workbench during development to connect
with the database, and to read or write table information.

For more information on how to use a development login to connect to a
database, see Logging In to the Database.

Deployment Login

The Defined Login to be used by your EclipseLink-enabled application
during deployment.

Development and Deployment Logins]

link:Introduction%20to%20Projects_(ELUG)#Development_Role[Development
Role]

== Logging In to the Database

Using Workbench, after you
link:#Configuring_Login_Information_at_the_Project_Level[create a login]
and specify it as a
link:#Configuring_Development_and_Deployment_Logins[development login],
you can log in to a database instance.

You must log in to the database before importing or exporting table
information.

To log in to the database using Workbench, use one of the following
procedures:

* Select the database object in the *Navigator* and click *Login*
image:loginbtn.gif[Database Login button,title="Database Login button"].
Workbench logs in to the database.
* Right-click on the database object in the *Navigator* and choose *Log
In to Database* from the context menu, or choose *Selected > Log In to
Database* from the menu.

image:logindb.gif[Database Logged In
icon,title="Database Logged In icon"] The database icon in the Navigator
window changes to indicate you are now logged in to the database.

== Configuring Named Query Parameterized SQL and Statement Caching at the Project Level

You can configure EclipseLink to use parameterized SQL (parameter
binding) and prepared statement caching for all named queries and
finders.

By default, EclipseLink uses parameterized SQL.

The use of parameterized SQL lets you create and store queries that are
complete except for one or more bound parameters. The EclipseLink
runtime binds the current parameter values when executing the query.
This approach avoids the preparation of SQL execution and, thus,
improves the performance of frequently executed SQL statements.

This section describes configuring parameterized SQL and statement
caching options at the project level. This configuration applies to
_all_ named queries or finders (see
link:Introduction%20to%20EclipseLink%20Queries%20(ELUG)[Named Queries])
you create on the descriptors in this project–not to all queries in
general or write operations.

You can also configure parameterized SQL and statement caching options
at the named query or finder-level to override this project-level
configuration on a query-by-query basis (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Descriptor%20(ELUG)#Configuring_Named_Query_Options[Configuring
Named Query Options]) or at the session login-level (see
link:Configuring%20a%20Database%20Login%20(ELUG)#Configuring_JDBC_Options[Configuring
JDBC Options]).

For more information, see
link:Optimizing%20the%20EclipseLink%20Application%20(ELUG)#How_to_Use_Parameterized_SQL_(Parameter_Binding)_and_Prepared_Statement_Caching_for_Optimization[How
to Use Parameterized SQL (Parameter Binding) and Prepared Statement
Caching for Optimization].

[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|===
|*Note*: For applications using a Java EE data source or external
connection pool, you must configure statement caching in the Java EE
server’s data source–not in EclipseLink.
|===

This table summarizes which projects support parameterized SQL and
statement caching configuration.
