[[USINGMULTIDBS]]
== Using Multiple Databases with a CompositeÂ Persistence Unit

With EclipseLink, you can expose multiple persistence units (each with
unique sets of entity types) as a single persistence context by using a
_composite persistence unit_. Individual persistence units that are part
of this composite persistence unit are called _composite member
persistence units_.

NOTE: EclipseLink also supports multiple databases through partitioning. See
xref:{relativedir}/scaling.adoc#SCALING[Chapter 10, "Scaling Applications in
Clusters"] for more information.

This chapter includes the following sections:

* xref:{relativedir}/usingmultipledbs001.adoc#USINGMULTIDBS001[Introduction to the Solution]
* xref:{relativedir}/usingmultipledbs002.adoc#USINGMULTIDBS002[Implementing the Solution]
* xref:{relativedir}/usingmultipledbs003.adoc#USINGMULTIDBS003[Additional Resources]

*Use Case*

Users need to map expose multiple persistence units as a single
persistence context within an application.

*Solution*

EclipseLink supports a "composite" persistence unit which can include
multiple member persistence units.

*Components*

* EclipseLink 2.4.2 or later.
* Multiple databases.

*Sample*

See the following EclipseLink examples for related information:
