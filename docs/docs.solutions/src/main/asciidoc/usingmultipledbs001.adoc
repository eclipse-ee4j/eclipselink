=== Introduction to the Solution

With a composite persistence unit, you can:

* Map relationships among any of the entities in multiple persistence
units
* Access entities stored in multiple databases and different data
sources
* Easily perform queries and transactions across the complete set of
entities

link:#CIHFBBDJ[Example 9-1] shows how you can persist data from a single
persistence context into two different databases:

[[CIHFBBDJ]]

*_Example 9-1 Using Multiple Databases_*

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
em.persist(new A(..));
em.persist(new B(..));
// You can insert A into database1 and insert B into database2.
// The two databases can be from different vendors.

em.flush();
----

link:#BABJAABI[Figure 9-1] illustrates a simple composite persistence
unit. EclipseLink processes the `persistence.xml` file and detects the
composite persistence unit, which contains two composite member
persistence units:

* Class *A* is mapped by a persistence unit named *memberPu1* located in
the `member1.jar` file.
* Class *B* is mapped by a persistence unit named *memberPu2* located in
the `member2.jar` file.

=== Composite Persistence Unit Requirements

When using composite persistence units, note the following requirements:

* The name of each composite member persistence unit must be unique
within the composite.
* The `transaction-type` and other properties that correspond to the
entire persistence unit (such as target server, logging, transactions,
and so on) should be defined in the composite persistence unit. If not,
the transaction types, target server information, and logging properties
defined with composite members will be ignored.
