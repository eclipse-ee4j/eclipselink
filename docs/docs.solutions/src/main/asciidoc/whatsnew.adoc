== What's New in This Guide

The following topics introduce the new and changed features of
EclipseLink and other significant changes that are described in this
guide, and provides pointers to additional information.

=== New and Changed Features for Release {release-version}

* Serialized object policy, for storing a serialized version of an
entity into a single column in the database. See
xref:{relativedir}/performance001.adoc#BBAJBHBI["Serialized Object Policy"].
* Automated tuning, for a dynamic single tuning option. See "Automated
Tuning" on page 18-8.

=== Other Significant Changes in this Document for Release {release-version}

=== New and Changed Features for 12c (12.1.2)

EclipseLink 2.4.2 includes the following new and changed features that
are documented in this book. This list does not necessarily include all
new or changed features in this release. It only includes the new
features that are documented in this book.

* Client isolation, where multiple application tenants may share
database tables and schemas. This allows applications to manage entities
for multiple tenants in the same application. See
xref:{relativedir}/multitenancy.adoc#MULTITENANCY[Chapter 14, "Tenant Isolation Using
EclipseLink."]
* JSON bindings, for converting objects directly to and from JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON). This can be useful when creating RESTful
services, using JSON messages with Java API for RESTful Web Services
(JAX-RS) services. See xref:{relativedir}/json.adoc#JSON[Chapter 16, "Converting
Objects to and from JSON Documents,"]
* RESTful persistence, where Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) entities can
be exposed through standards-based RESTful services such as JAX-RS,
using either JSON or XML media. See
xref:{relativedir}/restful_jpa.adoc#RESTJPA[Chapter 19, "Exposing JPA Entities Through
RESTful Data Services."]
* Support for TopLink Database Change Notification (DCN), which allows
the database to notify TopLink of database changes so that cached
objects can be invalidated in the shared cache. See
xref:{relativedir}/qcn.adoc#QCN[Chapter 20, "Using Database Events to Invalidate
the Cache."]
* NoSQL database support, allowing objects to be mapped to
non-relational (NoSQL) data sources. See
xref:{relativedir}/nonrelational_db.adoc#NOSQL[Chapter 21, "Using EclipseLink with
NoSQL Databases,"].

For a complete list of the changes in this release, see
`http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/releases/2.5.php`.

=== Other Significant Changes in this Document for 12c (12.1.2)

For this release of EclipseLink, this guide has been updated in several
ways. Following are the sections that have been added or changed.

* Moved installation information from appendix to
xref:{relativedir}/install.adoc#INSTALL[Chapter 2, "Installing EclipseLink,"].
* Added new chapter, xref:{relativedir}/jboss.adoc#ELJBOSS[Chapter 5, "Using
EclipseLink with JBoss 7 Application Server,"] to describe how
EclipseLink can be used with applications deployed to JBoss Application
Server 7.1.
* Added new chapter, xref:{relativedir}/websphere.adoc#ELWS[Chapter 6, "Using
EclipseLink with IBM WebSphere Application Server,"] to describe how
EclipseLink can be used with applications deployed to IBM WebSphere
Application Server
* Added new chapter, xref:{relativedir}/migrnativetoplink.adoc#MIGRATETOPLINK[Chapter 7,
"Migrating from Native TopLink,"] to describe migrate applications using
"native" TopLink object-relational mapping (ORM) APIs to the current
EclipseLink APIs.
* Added information about data partitioning in
xref:{relativedir}/scaling.adoc#SCALING[Chapter 10, "Scaling Applications in
Clusters."]
* Split xref:{relativedir}/saas.adoc#SAAS[Chapter 11, "Providing Software as a
Service."] into four chapters:
** xref:{relativedir}/saas.adoc#SAAS[Chapter 11, "Providing Software as a
Service."] This is now just an overview of the following three chapters.
** xref:{relativedir}/extensible.adoc#EXTENSIBLE[Chapter 12, "Making JPA Entities and
JAXB Beans Extensible"]
** xref:{relativedir}/metadatasource.adoc#METADATASOURCE[Chapter 13, "Using an External
MetaData Source"]
** xref:{relativedir}/multitenancy.adoc#MULTITENANCY[Chapter 14, "Tenant Isolation Using
EclipseLink"] and also updated this chapter with information about
Virtual Private Database (VPD) multi-tenancy and table-per-tenant
multi-tenancy
* Added new chapter, xref:{relativedir}/json.adoc#JSON[Chapter 16, "Converting
Objects to and from JSON Documents,"] to describe how to convert objects
directly to and from JSON
* Added information about weaving to
xref:{relativedir}/testingjpa.adoc#TESTINGJPA[Chapter 17, "Testing JPA Outside a
Container,"] to describe how to use the persistence unit JAR file to
test an application outside theÂ container (for instance, in applications
for the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE platform)).
* Added new chapter, xref:{relativedir}/restful_jpa.adoc#RESTJPA[Chapter 19, "Exposing
JPA Entities Through RESTful Data Services,"] to describe how to expose
JPA entities through Jakarta Persistence API-RESTful Services (JPA-RS),
using either JSON or XML media.
* Added new chapter, xref:{relativedir}/qcn.adoc#QCN[Chapter 20, "Using Database
Events to Invalidate the Cache,"] to describe how to use EclipseLink
Database Change Notification (DCN) for shared caching in a JPA
environment. DCN allows the database to notify EclipseLink of database
changes. The changed objects are invalidated in the EclipseLink shared
cache. Stale data can be discarded, even if other applications access
the same data in the database.
* Added new chapter, xref:{relativedir}/oracledb.adoc#ORACLEDB[Chapter 22, "Using
EclipseLink with the Oracle Database,"] to describe how to use the
Oracle Database features that are supported by EclipseLink.
