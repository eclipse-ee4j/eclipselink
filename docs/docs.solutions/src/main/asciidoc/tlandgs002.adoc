==== Task 2: Install GlassFish Server

EclipseLink is included with the GlassFish Server distribution. You can
find instructions for installing and configuring GlassFish Server at
this URL:

`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/index.htm`

The EclipseLink modules appear as separate JAR files in the `modules`
directory.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
* \glassfish\modules
      .
      .
      .
      o org.eclipse.persistence.antlr.jar
      o org.eclipse.persistence.core.jar

[NOTE]
====
* The `org.eclipse.persistence.oracle.jar` file is available with
GlassFish and provides Oracle Database-specific functionality for
EclipseLink. This file is used only for applications running against an
Oracle Database.
====

Object-XML (also known as JAXB support, or _MOXy_) is a component that
enables you to bind Java classes to XML schemas. This support is
provided by the `org.eclipse.persistence.moxy.jar`.

==== Task 3: Set Up the Data Source

Configuring an Oracle database as a JDBC resource for a Jakarta EE
application involves the following steps:

. link:#CIHDEDEE[Integrate the JDBC Driver for Oracle Database into
GlassFish Server]
. link:#CIHFIGGF[Create a JDBC Connection Pool for the Resource]
. link:#CIHIDADF[Create the JDBC Resource]

[[CIHDEDEE]]

===== Integrate the JDBC Driver for Oracle Database into GlassFish Server

To integrate the JDBC driver, copy its JAR file into the domain and then
restart the domain and instances to make the driver available.

. Copy the JAR file for the JDBC driver into the domain's `lib`
subdirectory, for example:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd /home/gfuser/glassfish3
cp oracle-jdbc-drivers/ojdbc6.jar glassfish/domains/domain1/lib
----
+
Note that you do not have to restart GlassFish Server; the drivers are
picked up dynamically.
+
If the application uses Oracle Database-specific extensions provided by
EclipseLink, then the driver must be copied to the `lib/ext` directory.
For more information, see "Oracle Database Enhancements" in the _Oracle
GlassFish Server Application Development Guide_ at:
+
`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24930/jpa.htm#giqbi`
. You can use the GlassFish Server Administration Console or the command
line to restart instances in the domain to make the JDBC driver
available to the instances.
+
*To use the GlassFish Server Administration Console:*
+
In the GlassFish Server Administration Console, expand the *Cluster*
node. Select the node for the cluster and on its General Information
page, click the *Instances* tab. Select the instances you want to
restart. For more information, see "To Start Clustered GlassFish Server
Instances" in _GlassFish Server Administration Console Online Help_.
+
To start a standalone instance, expand the *Standalone* *Instances*
node. For each instance that you are starting, select the instance in
the Server Instances table. Click Start. The status of each instance is
updated in the Server Instances table when the instance is started. For
more information, see "To Start Standalone GlassFish Server Instances"
in _GlassFish Server Administration Console Online Help_.
+
*To use the command line:*
+
Run the `restart-instance` subcommand to restart the instances. These
commands assume that your instances are named `pmd-i1` and `pmd-i2`.
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
restart-instance pmd-i1
restart-instance pmd-i2
----

[[CIHFIGGF]]

===== Create a JDBC Connection Pool for the Resource

You can create a JDBC connection pool from the GlassFish Server
Administration Console or from the command line.

*To use the GlassFish Server Administration Console:*

In the GlassFish Server Administration Console, expand the *Common*
*Tasks* node, then click the *Create New JDBC Connection Pool* button in
the Common Tasks page. Specify the name of the pool, the resource type,
the name of the database provider, the data source and driver class
names, and other details. For more information, see "To Create a JDBC
Connection Pool" in _GlassFish Server Administration Console Online
Help_.

*To use the command line:*

. Use the `create-jdbc-connection-pool` subcommand to create the JDBC
connection pool, specifying the database connectivity values. In this
command, note the use of two backslashes (`\\`) preceding the colons in
the URL property value. These backslashes cause the colons to be
interpreted as part of the property value instead of as separators
between property-value pairs, for example:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
create-jdbc-connection-pool 
  --datasourceclassname oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource 
  --restype javax.sql.DataSource 
  --property User=smith\\:Password=password\\:url=jdbc\\:oracle\\:thin\\:@node_name.example.com\\:1521\\:smithdb 
    poolbvcallbackbmt 
----
. Verify connectivity to the database.
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ping-connection-pool pool_name 
----

[[CIHIDADF]]

===== Create the JDBC Resource

You can use the GlassFish Server Administration Console to create the
JDBC resource or you can use the command line.

*To use the GlassFish Server Administration Console:*

In the GlassFish Server Administration Console, expand the *Resources*
node, then the *JDBC* node, then the *JDBC* *Resources* node to open the
JDBC Resources page. Provide a unique JNDI resource name and associate
the resource with a connection pool. For more information, see "To
Create a JDBC Resource" in the _GlassFish Server Administration Console
Online Help_.

*To use the command line:*

Use the `create-jdbc-resource` subcommand to create the JDBC resource,
and name it so that the application can discover it using JNDI lookup,
for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid poolbvcallbackbmt jdbc/bvcallbackbmt
----

[[CIHBFDDB]]

==== Task 4: Create the persistence.xml File

link:#CIHJGIEF[Example 4-1] illustrates a sample `persistence.xml` file
that specifies the default persistence provider for EclipseLink,
`org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider`. For more information
about this file, see "About the Persistence Unit" in _EclipseLink
Concepts_.

If you are using the default persistence provider, then you can specify
additional database properties described in _Jakarta Persistence API
(JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

Several of the values you enter in the file must match the values you
chose when you defined the cluster, connection, and connection pool
properties in GlassFish Server, as follows:

*JDBC Data Source Properties:*

* *Name*: The name of the data source, which is typically the same as
the JNDI name, for example `jdbc/bvcallbackbmt`.
* *JNDI* *Name*: The JNDI path to where this data source is bound. This
must be the same name as the value for the `<jta-data-source>` element
in `persistence.xml`, for example `jdbc/bvcallbackbmt`.
* *Database* *Type*: `Oracle`
* *Database* *Driver*: (default) Oracle's Driver (Thin XA) for Instance
connections; Versions: 9.0.1 and later

*Connection Properties:*

* *Database* *Name*: The name of the database, for example, `XE` for
Oracle Database Express Edition samples.
* *Host* *Name*: The IP address of the database server, for example
`127.0.0.1` for a locally hosted database.
* *Port*: The port number on which your database server listens for
connection requests, for example, `1521`, the default for Oracle
Database Express Edition 11__g__.
* *Database* *User* *Name*: The database account user name used to
create database connections, for example `hr` for Oracle Database
Express Edition 11__g__ samples.
* *Password*: Your password.

*Select Targets:*

* *Servers* */* *Clusters*: Select the administration server, managed
servers, or clusters to which you want to deploy the data source. You
can choose one or more.

The sample `persistence.xml` file in link:#CIHJGIEF[Example 4-1]
highlights the properties defining the persistence provider, the JTA
data source, and logging details. In this example, the logging level is
set to `FINE`. At this level, SQL code generated by EclipseLink is
logged to the `server.log` file. For more information about these
properties, see:

* link:#CIHFFHAE[Specify the Persistence Provider.]
* link:#CIHCBCIC[Specify an Oracle Database.]
* link:#CIHHJIGF[Specify Logging.]

[[CIHJGIEF]]

*_Example 4-1 Sample persistence.xml File_*

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence" version="2.0">

                 value="drop-and-create-tables"/>
    </properties>
  </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
----

[[CIHFFHAE]]

===== Specify the Persistence Provider

The persistence provider defines the implementation of JPA. It is
defined in the `provider` element of the `persistence.xml` file.
Persistence providers are vendor-specific. The persistence provider for
EclipseLink is `org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider`.

[[CIHCBCIC]]

===== Specify an Oracle Database

You specify the database connection details in the `persistence.xml`
file. GlassFish Server uses the bundled Java DB (Derby) database by
default, named `jdbc/__default`. To use a nondefault database, such as
the Oracle Database, either specify a value for the `jta-data-source`
element, or set the `transaction-type` element to `RESOURCE_LOCAL` and
specify a value for the `non-jta-data-source` element.

If you are using the default persistence provider,
`org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider`, then the provider
attempts to automatically detect the database type based on the
connection metadata. This database type is used to issue SQL statements
specific to the detected database type. You can specify the optional
`eclipselink.target-database` property to guarantee that the database
type is correct.

For more information about specifying database properties in a
`persistence.xml` file for GlassFish Server, see "Specifying the
Database for an Application" in the _Oracle GlassFish Server Application
Development Guide_, at:

`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24930/jpa.htm#gbwmj`

[[CIHHJIGF]]

===== Specify Logging

EclipseLink provides a logging utility even though logging is not part
of the JPA specification. Hence, the information provided by the log is
EclipseLink JPA-specific. With EclipseLink, you can enable logging to
view the following information:

* Configuration details
* Information to facilitate debugging
* The SQL that is being sent to the database

You can specify logging in the `persistence.xml` file. EclipseLink
logging properties let you specify the level of logging and whether the
log output goes to a file or standard output. Because the logging
utility is based on `java.util.logging`, you can specify a logging level
to use.

The logging utility provides nine levels of logging control over the
amount and detail of the log output. Use `eclipselink.logging.level` to
set the logging level, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.logging.level" value="FINE"/>
----

By default, the log output goes to `System.out` or to the console. To
configure the output to be logged to a file, set the property
`eclipselink.logging.file`, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.logging.file" value="output.log"/>
----

EclipseLink's logging utility is pluggable, and several different
logging integrations are supported, including `java.util.logging`. To
enable `java.util.logging`, set the property
`eclipselink.logging.logger`, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.logging.logger" value="JavaLogger"/>
----

While running inside GlassFish Server, EclipseLink is configured by
GlassFish Server to use `JavaLogger` by default. The log is always
redirected to the GlassFish Server `server.log` file. For more
information, see "Setting Log Levels" in _Oracle GlassFish Server
Administration Guide_, at:

`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24928/logging.htm#gklml`

For more information about EclipseLink logging and the levels of logging
available in the logging utility, see "Persistence Property Extensions
Reference" in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for
EclipseLink_.

[[CIHDDACF]]

==== Task 5: Set Up GlassFish Server for JPA

_GlassFish Server Application Development Guide_ describes
server-specific considerations on setting up GlassFish Server to run
applications that employ JPA:

`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24930/jpa.htm`

It provides more information about these topics:

* "Specifying the Database for an Application," for information about
database connection properties
* "Specifying the Persistence Provider for an Application," for setting
the default or non-default persistence provider for an application
* "Primary Key Generation Defaults," for the default persistence
provider's primary key generation defaults
* "Automatic Schema Generation," for information on annotations and
options to manage automatic schema generation
* "Restrictions and Optimizations," for restrictions and performance
optimizations that affect using the Jakarta Persistence API

[[CIHHDEFE]]

==== Task 6: Create the Application

To create an application that uses EclipseLink as its JPA persistence
provider, you may want to use a Jakarta EE IDE for convenience during
development. For example, JDeveloper, Oracle Enterprise Pack for
Eclipse, and NetBeans provide sophisticated Jakarta EE development
tools, including support for EclipseLink. See "Key Tools" in
_EclipseLink Concepts_.

For guidance in writing your application, see these topics from the
"Configuring the Java Persistence Provider" chapter in _Oracle GlassFish
Server Application Development Guide_, at:

`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24930/jpa.htm`

[[CIHCFJDE]]

==== Task 7: Deploy the Application to GlassFish Server

For information about deploying to GlassFish Server, see "Deploy
Applications or Modules," "To Deploy an Enterprise Application," and "To
Deploy a Web Application" in _GlassFish Server Administration Console
Online Help_. See also _Oracle GlassFish Server Application Deployment
Guide_, at:

`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/index.htm`

[[CIHFIGGB]]

==== Task 8: Run the Application

For instructions for starting a deployed application from the GlassFish
Server Administration Console, see "Application Client Launch" and "To
Launch an Application" in _GlassFish Server Administration Console
Online Help_.

[[CIHIFGEF]]

==== Task 9: Monitor the Application

GlassFish Server provides a monitoring service to track the health and
performance of an application. For information about monitoring an
application from the console, see the "Monitoring" and "Monitoring Data"
topics in _GlassFish Server Administration Console Online Help_. For
information about monitoring the application from the command line, see
"Administering the Monitoring Service" in _Oracle GlassFish Server
Administration Guide_, at:

`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24928/monitoring.htm`
