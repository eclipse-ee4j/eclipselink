[[TESTINGJPA]]
== Testing JPA Outside a Container

This chapter describes how, with EclipseLink, you can use the
persistence unit JAR file to test your application outside theÂ container
(for instance, in applications for the Java Platform, Standard Edition
(Java SE platform)).

This chapter includes the following sections:

* xref:{relativedir}/testingjpa001.adoc#TESTINGJPA001[Understanding JPA Deployment]
* xref:{relativedir}/testingjpa002.adoc#TESTINGJPA002[Configuring the persistence.xml File]
* xref:{relativedir}/testingjpa003.adoc#TESTINGJPA003[Using a Property Map]
* xref:{relativedir}/testingjpa004.adoc#TESTINGJPA004[Using Weaving]
* xref:{relativedir}/testingjpa005.adoc#TESTINGJPA005[Additional Resources]

*Use Case*

Users need to use EclipseLink both inside and outside the container
(such as applications for the Java SE platform).

*Solution*

This solution highlights the primary differences when using EclipseLink
outside a container.

*Components*

* EclipseLink 2.4 or later.
* An application server (such as Oracle WebLogic Server, IBM WebSphere,
or Glassfish)
