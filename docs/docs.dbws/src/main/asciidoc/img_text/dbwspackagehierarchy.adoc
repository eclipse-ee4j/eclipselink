This figure shows the concrete implementations of the `DBWSPackager`
interface. Both the `JavasePackager` and `WebServicePackager` (which is
an implementation of the `WebLogicPackager` and `JDevPackger`) implement
the ProviderPackager which, in turn, implements the XRPackager, which
implements the `DBWSPackgter` interface.
