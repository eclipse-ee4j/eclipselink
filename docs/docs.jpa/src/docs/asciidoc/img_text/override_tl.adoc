This illustration shows how the EclipseLink JPA overriding mechanism
works in the case of usage of `eclipselink.sessions-xml` persistence
unit property: This defines a `sessions.xml` file, which references a
`project.xml` file. In this case, the EclipseLink persistence provider
builds an in-memory EclipseLink session and project based on this
metadata.
