=== Solving Object-XML Impedance Mismatch

Although XML is a common format for the exchange of data, for many
applications _objects_ are the preferred programmatic representation â€“
not XML. In order to work at the object-level, the XML data needs to be
converted to object form. The mismatch between XML and objects is known
as _object-xml impedance mismatch_.

JAXB allows you to interact with XML data by using domain-like objects.
Unlike DOM objects, the JAXB content model provides insight into the XML
document based on the XML schema. For example, if the XML schema defines
XML documents that contain customer information, your content model will
contain objects such as *Customer*, *Address*, and *PhoneNumber*. Each
_type_ in the XML schema will have a corresponding Java class.

With EclipseLink MOXy, you can efficiently bind Java classes to XML
schemas or JSON documents. MOXy implements JAXB by allowing you to
provide mapping information through annotations _as well as storing the
mappings in XML_ or JSON. By using the EclipseLink's advanced mappings,
you can manage complex XML structures _without_ having to mirror the
schema in your Java class model.
