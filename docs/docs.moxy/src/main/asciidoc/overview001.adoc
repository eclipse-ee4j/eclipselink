=== About EclipseLink MOXy

When using EclipseLink MOXy as the JAXB provider, no metadata is
required to convert your existing object model to XML or JSON. You can
supply metadata (using annotations, XML, or JSON) only when fine-tuning
of the XML or JSON representation is required.

EclipseLink MOXy includes many advanced mappings that allows you to
handle complex XML structures without having to mirror the schema in the
Java class model.
