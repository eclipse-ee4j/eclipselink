[[INTRODUCTION]]
== Introduction

JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding â€“ JSR 222) is the standard for
XML Binding in Java. JAXB covers 100% of XML Schema concepts and
EclipseLink provides a JAXB implementation with many extensions. See
`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=222` for complete information on the
JAXB specification.

The EclipseLink MOXy component enables developers to efficiently bind
Java classes to XML schemas and JSON documents. MOXy implements JAXB,
allowing developers to provide their mapping information through
annotations __as well as providing support for storing the mappings in
XML and JSON format__s.
