This figure illustrates XML direct mapping to different text nodes of
different binary types in a corresponding XML document. The *Customer*
class contains the attributes *picture* and *resume*, both of type
*byte[]*. `id`. The *picture* attribute maps to the `<picture>` element
in the XML document; the *resume* attribute maps to the `<resume>`
element. The XPath for the *picture* attribute is *picture/text()*. The
XPath for the *resume* attribute is *resume/text()*.
