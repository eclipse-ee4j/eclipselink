This figure illustrates an XML direct collection mapping to text nodes
with a grouping element. The class *Customer* contains the attribute
*emailAddress* of type *List*. The *emailAddress* attribute maps to the
two `<email-address>` elements (in the `<email-addresses>` group
element) in the XML document.
