This figure illustrates an XML direct mapping to individual text nodes
in a corresponding XML *document*. The Customer class contains two
attributes: *firstName* and *lastName*. The firstName attribute maps to
the *<first-name>* element in the XML document; the *lastName* attribute
maps to the *<last-name>* element. The XPath for the firstName is
mapping is *first-name/text()*; the lastName is *last-name/text()*.
