[[RUNTIME]]
== EclipseLink MOXy Runtime

This chapter introduces and describes EclipseLink MOXy. EclipseLink MOXy
is one implementation of the standard runtime defined by the JAXB
specification.

To specify EclipseLink MOXy as your JAXB provider:

* Add the JAXB APIs (included in Java SE 6) and `eclipselink.jar` on
your classpath.
* Use a `jaxb.properties` file (in the same package as your domain
classes).

This chapter includes the following sections:
