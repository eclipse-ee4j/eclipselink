=== About the Persistence Unit

A persistence unit defines the details that are required when you
acquire an entity manager. To package your EclipseLink JPA application,
you must configure the persistence unit during the creation of the
`persistence.xml` file. Define each persistence unit in a
`persistence-unit` element in the `persistence.xml` file.

Use the `persistence.xml` file to package your entities. Once you choose
a packaging strategy, place the `persistence.xml` file in the `META-INF`
directory of the archive of your choice. The following sections provide
more detail on how to specify the persistence unit. For more information
and examples, see "persistence.xml file" in the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338[JPA Specification]. For information
on EclipseLink extensions to the `persistence.xml` file, see
"Persistence Property Extensions Reference" in _Jakarta Persistence API
(JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

==== About the Persistence Unit Name

If you are developing your application in a Jakarta EE environment,
ensure that the persistence unit name is unique within each module. For
example, you can define only one persistence unit with the name
`EmployeeService` in an `emp_ejb.jar` file.

For more information, see http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["name" in
the JPA Specification].

==== About the Persistence Provider

The persistence provider defines the implementation of JPA. It is
defined in the `provider` element of the `persistence.xml` file.
Persistence providers are vendor-specific. The persistence provider for
EclipseLink is `org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider`.

[[BGBJGFGJ]][[OTLCG94292]]

==== About the Transaction Type Data Source

If you are developing your application in a Jakarta EE environment, use
the default transaction type: `JTA` (for Java Transaction API) and
specify the data source in a `jta-data-source` element.

If you are using a data source that does not conform to the JTA, then
set the `transaction-type` element to `RESOURCE_LOCAL` and specify a
value for the `non-jta-data-source` element.

If you are using the default persistence provider,
`org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider`, then the provider
attempts to automatically detect the database type based on the
connection metadata. This database type is used to issue SQL statements
specific to the detected database type. You can specify the optional
`eclipselink.target-database` property to guarantee that the database
type is correct.

For more information, see
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["transaction-type"] and
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["provider" in the JPA
Specification].

==== About Logging

EclipseLink provides a logging utility even though logging is not part
of the JPA specification. Hence, the information provided by the log is
EclipseLink JPA-specific. With EclipseLink, you can enable logging to
view the following information:

* Configuration details
* Information to facilitate debugging
* The SQL that is being sent to the database

You can specify logging in the `persistence.xml` file. EclipseLink
logging properties let you specify the level of logging and whether the
log output goes to a file or standard output. Because the logging
utility is based on `java.util.logging`, you can specify a logging level
to use.

The logging utility provides nine levels of logging control over the
amount and detail of the log output. Use `eclipselink.logging.level` to
set the logging level, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.logging.level" value="FINE"/>
----

By default, the log output goes to `System.out` or to the console. To
configure the output to be logged to a file, set the property
`eclipselink.logging.file`, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.logging.file" value="output.log"/>
----

EclipseLink's logging utility is pluggable, and several different
logging integrations are supported, including `java.util.logging`. To
enable `java.util.logging`, set the property
`eclipselink.logging.logger`, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<property name="eclipselink.logging.logger" value="JavaLogger"/>
----

For more information about EclipseLink logging and the levels of logging
available in the logging utility, see "Persistence Property Extensions
Reference" in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for
EclipseLink_.

[[BGBBEFAC]][[OTLCG94295]]

==== About Vendor Properties

The last section in the `persistence.xml` file is the `properties`
section. The `properties` element gives you the chance to supply
EclipseLink persistence provider-specific settings for the persistence
unit. See http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["properties" in the JPA
Specification]. see also "Persistence Property Extensions Reference" in
_Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[BGBEGAEA]][[OTLCG94293]]

==== About Mapping Files

Apply the metadata to the persistence unit. This metadata is a union of
all the mapping files and the annotations (if there is no
`xml-mapping-metadata-complete` element). If you use one mapping
`orm.xml` file for your metadata, and place this file in a `META-INF`
directory on the classpath, then you do not need to explicitly list it.
The EclipseLink persistence provider will automatically search for this
file and use it. If you named your mapping files differently or placed
them in a different location, then you must list them in the
mapping-file elements in the `persistence.xml` file.

For more information, see
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["mapping-file, jar-file, class,
exclude-unlisted-classes" in the JPA Specification].

[[BGBHFFAG]][[OTLCG94294]]

==== About Managed Classes

Typically, you put all of the entities and other managed classes in a
single JAR file, along with the `persistence.xml` file in the `META-INF`
directory, and one or more mapping files (when you store metadata in
XML).

At the time the EclipseLink persistence provider processes the
persistence unit, it determines which set of entities, mapped
superclasses, embedded objects, and converters each particular
persistence unit will manage.

At deployment time, the EclipseLink persistence provider may obtain
managed classes from any of the following sources. A managed class will
be included if it is one of the following:

* Local classes: the classes annotated with `@Entity`,
`@MappedSuperclass`, `@Embeddable`, or `@Converter` in the deployment
unit in which its `persistence.xml` file was packaged. For more
information, see http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["Entity" in the JPA
Specification].

NOTE: If you are deploying your application in the Jakarta EE environment, the
application server itself, not the EclipseLink persistence provider,
will discover local classes. In the Java SE environment, you can use the
`exclude-unlisted-classes` element to `false` to enable this
functionalityâ€”EclipseLink persistence provider will attempt to find
local classes if you set this element to false. See
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["mapping-file, jar-file, class,
exclude-unlisted-classes" in the JPA Specification].

* Classes in mapping files: the classes that have mapping entries, such
as entity (see http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["entity" in the JPA
Specification]), mapped-superclass or embeddable, in an XML mapping
file. For more information, see
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["mapped-superclass"] and
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["embeddable" in the JPA
Specification].
+
If these classes are in the deployed component archive, then they will
already be on the classpath. If they are not, you must explicitly
include them in the classpath.
* Explicitly listed classes: the classes that are listed as class
elements in the `persistence.xml` file.
Consider listing classes explicitly if one of the following applies:
** there are additional classes that are not local to the deployment
unit JAR. For example, there is an embedded object class in a different
JAR that you want to use in an entity in your persistence unit. You
would list the fully qualified class in the class element in the
`persitence.xml` file. You would also need to ensure that the JAR or
directory that contains the class is on the classpath of the deployed
component (by adding it to the manifest classpath of the deployment JAR,
for example);
** you want to exclude one or more classes that may be annotated as an
entity. Even though the class may be annotated with the `@Entity`
annotation, you do not want it treated as an entity in this particular
deployed context. For example, you may want to use this entity as a
transfer object and it needs to be part of the deployment unit. In this
case, in the Jakarta EE environment, you have to use the
`exclude-unlisted-classes` element of the `persistence.xml` fileâ€”the use
of the default setting of this element prevents local classes from being
added to the persistence unit. For more information, see "mapping-file,
jar-file, class, exclude-unlisted-classes" of the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338[JPA Specification].
** you plan to run your application in the Java SE environment, and you
list your classes explicitly because that is the only portable way to do
so in Java SE.
* Additional JAR files of managed classes: the annotated classes in a
named JAR file listed in a `jar-file` element in the `persistence.xml`
file. For more information, see
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["mapping-file, jar-file, class,
exclude-unlisted-classes" in the JPA Specification].
+
You have to ensure that any JAR file listed in the `jar-file` element is
on the classpath of the deployment unit. Do so by manually adding the
JAR file to the manifest classpath of the deployment unit.
+
Note that you must list the JAR file in the `jar-file` element relative
to the parent of the JAR file in which the `persistence.xml` file is
located. This matches what you would put in the classpath entry in the
manifest file.

[[BGBDCBJJ]][[OTLCG94296]]

==== About the Deployment Classpath

To be accessible to the EJB JAR, WAR, or EAR file, a class or a JAR file
must be on the deployment classpath. You can achieve this in one of the
following ways:

* Put the JAR file in the manifest classpath of the EJB JAR or WAR file.
+
To do this, add a classpath entry to the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file in
the JAR or WAR file. You can specify one or more directories or JAR
files, separating them by spaces.
* Place the JAR file in the library directory of the EAR file.
+
This will make the JAR file available on the application classpath and
accessible by all of the modules deployed within the EAR file. By
default, this would be the `lib` directory of the EAR file, although you
may configure it to be any directory in the EAR file using the
`library-directory` element in the `application.xml` deployment
descriptor.

[[BGBJGHBG]][[OTLCG94297]]

==== About Persistence Unit Packaging Options

Jakarta EE allows for persistence support in a variety of packaging
configurations. You can deploy your application to the following module
types:

* EJB modules: you can package your entities in an EJB JAR. When
defining a persistence unit in an EJB JAR, the `persistence.xml` file is
not optionalâ€“you must create and place it in the `META-INF` directory of
the JAR alongside the deployment descriptor, if it exists.
* Web modules: you can use a WAR file to package your entities. In this
case, place the `persistence.xml` file in the `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF`
directory. Since the `WEB-INF/classes` directory is automatically on the
classpath of the WAR, specify the mapping file relative to that
directory.
* Persistence archives: a persistence archive is a JAR that contains a
`persistence.xml` file in its `META-INF` directory and the managed
classes for the persistence unit defined by the `persistence.xml` file.
Use a persistence archive if you want to allow multiple components in
different Jakarta EE modules to share or access a persistence unit.
+
Once you create a persistence archive, you can place it in either the
root or the application library directory of the EAR. Alternatively, you
can place the persistence archive in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory of a
WAR. This will make the persistence unit accessible only to the classes
inside the WAR, but it enables the decoupling of the definition of the
persistence unit from the web archive itself.

For more information, see
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["Persistence Unit Packaging" in the
JPA Specification].

[[BGBCJBGD]][[OTLCG94298]]

==== About the Persistence Unit Scope

You can define any number of persistence units in single
`persistence.xml` file. The following are the rules for using defined
and packaged persistence units:

* Persistence units are accessible only within the scope of their
definition.
* Persistence units names must be unique within their scope.

For more information, see
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338["Persistence Unit Scope" in the JPA
Specification].

[[CHDBJIEH]]

==== About Composite Persistence Units

You can expose multiple persistence units (each with unique sets of
entity types) as a single persistence context by using a composite
persistence unit. Individual persistence units that are part of this
composite persistence unit are called composite member persistence
units.

With a composite persistence unit, you can:

* Map relationships among any of the entities in multiple persistence
units
* Access entities stored in multiple databases and different data
sources
* Easily perform queries and transactions across the complete set of
entities

link:#BABFADBE[Figure 3-1] illustrates a simple composite persistence
unit. EclipseLink processes the `persistence.xml` file and detects the
composite persistence unit, which contains two composite member
persistence units:

* Class *A* is mapped by a persistence unit named *memberPu1* located in
the `member1.jar` file.
* Class *B* is mapped by a persistence unit named *memberPu2* located in
the `member2.jar` file.
