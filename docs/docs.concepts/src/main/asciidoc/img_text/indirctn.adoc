This illustration shows an `Order` class that contains attributes
`orderId`, `lineItems`, and `customerId`. The `lineItems` attribute is a
reference to a collection of dependent `LineItem` objects. Without
indirection, reading the `Order` object also reads the dependent
collection of `LineItem` objects. With indirection, reading the `Order`
object does not read the dependent collection of `LineItem` objects: the
`lineItems` attribute refers to an indirection object. You can access
other attributes (such as `customerId`), but EclipseLink reads the
dependent `LineItem` objects only if and when you access the `lineItems`
attribute.
