This figure illustrates the relationship between entity architecture
elements. A `Persistence` class can create one or more
`EntityManagerFactory` objects. An `EntityManagerFactory` object can
create one or more `EntityManagers`. An `EntityManagerFactory` is
configured by one Persistence Unit. The properties defined by the
Persistence Unit are inherited by the `EntityManager`. The Persistence
Unit defines the Persistence Context. The Persistence Context is the set
of managed `Entity` instances within the `EntityManager`. One or more
`EntityManagers` can manage a Persistence Context.
