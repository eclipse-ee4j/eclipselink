=== About the MOXy Solution

The MOXy component, supplied by EclipseLink, enables you to efficiently
bind Java classes to XML schemas. MOXy implements JAXB, enabling you to
provide your mapping information through annotations and providing
support for storing the mappings in XML format.

JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding—JSR 222) is the standard for XML
Binding in Java. JAXB covers 100 percent of XML Schema concepts.
EclipseLink provides a JAXB implementation with many extensions.

When using EclipseLink MOXy as the JAXB provider, no metadata is
required to convert your existing object model to XML. You can supply
metadata (using annotations or XML) if you want to fine-tune the XML
representation.

MOXy includes many advanced mappings that let you handle complex XML
structures without having to mirror the schema in your Java class model.

For more information, see _Developing JAXB Applications EclipseLink
MOXy_.

The following sections describe many of these features.

==== Using EclipseLink MOXy as the JAXB Provider

To use MOXy as your JAXB provider, you must identify the entry point to
the JAXB runtime. This entry point is the EclipseLink
`JAXBContextFactory` class.

To identify the entry point, create a text file called `jaxb.properties`
and enter the path to the `JAXBContextFactory` class as the value of the
`jakarta.xml.bind.context.factory` context parameter, for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
jakarta.xml.bind.context.factory=org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory 
----

The `jaxb.properties` file must appear in the same package as the domain
classes.

==== Understanding MOXy Architecture

In the sample MOXy architecture illustrated in link:#CHDCBEEE[Figure
2-3], the starting point is an XML schema. A binding compiler binds the
source schema to a set of schema-derived program classes and interfaces.
JAXB-annotated classes within the application are generated either by a
schema compiler or the result of a developer adding JAXB annotations to
existing Java classes. The application can either marshal data to an XML
document or unmarshal the data to a tree of content objects. Each
content object is an instance of either a schema derived or an existing
program element mapped by the schema generator and corresponds to an
instance in the XML.

===== JAXB Contexts and JAXB Context Factories

The `JAXBContextFactory` class is the entry point into the EclipseLink
JAXB runtime. It provides the required factory methods and can create
new instances of `JAXBContext` objects.

The `JAXBContextFactory` class has the ability to:

* Create a `JAXBContext` object from an array of classes and a
properties object
* Create a `JAXBContext` object from a context path and a classloader

The `JAXBContext` class provides the client's entry point to the JAXB
API. The `JAXBContext` class is responsible for interpreting the
metadata, generating schema files, and for creating instances of these
JAXB objects: `Marshaller`, `Unmarshaller`, `Binder`, `Introspector`,
and `Validator`.

MOXy offers several options when creating the `JAXBContext` object. You
have the option of booting from:

* A list of one or more JAXB-annotated classes
* A list of one or more EclipseLink XML Bindings documents defining the
mappings for your Java classes
* A combination of classes and XML Bindings
* A list of context paths

==== Serving Metadata for MOXy

In addition to the input options described in link:#CHDDHHEI[JAXB
Contexts and JAXB Context Factories,] MOXy provides the concept of a
`MetadataSource` object. This object lets you to store mapping
information outside of your application and retrieve it when the
application's `JAXBContext` object is being created or refreshed. For
information on implementing `MetadataSource`, see _Developing JAXB
Applications EclipseLink MOXy_.

[[CHDCHHHI]][[OTLCG161]]

==== About XML Bindings

XML binding is how you represent information in an XML document as an
object in computer memory. This allows applications to access the data
in the XML from the object rather than using the Domain Object Model
(DOM), the Simple API for XML (SAX) or the Streaming API for XML (StAX)
to retrieve the data from a direct representation of the XML itself.
When binding, JAXB applies a tree structure to the graph of JPA
entities. Multiple tree representations of a graph are possible and will
depend on the root object chosen and the direction the relationships are
traversed.

EclipseLink enables you to use all of the standard JAXB annotations. In
addition to the standard annotations, EclipseLink offers another way of
expressing your metadata—the EclipseLink XML Bindings document. Not only
can XML Bindings separate your mapping information from your actual Java
class, it can also be used for more advanced metadata tasks such as:

* Augmenting or overriding existing annotations with additional mapping
information.
* Specifying all mappings information externally, without using Java
annotations.
* Defining your mappings across multiple Bindings documents.
* Specifying virtual mappings that do not correspond to concrete Java
fields.

For more information, see _Developing JAXB Applications EclipseLink
MOXy_.

==== Querying Objects by XPath

In addition to using conventional Java access methods to get and set
your object's values, EclipseLink MOXy also lets you access values using
an XPath statement. There are special APIs on EclipseLink's
`JAXBContext` object that enable you to get and set values by XPath. For
more information, see _Developing JAXB Applications EclipseLink MOXy_.
