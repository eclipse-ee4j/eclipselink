[[CHDJAHDC]][[OTLCG00083]]

==== Indirection (Lazy Loading)

By default, when EclipseLink retrieves a persistent object, it retrieves
all of the dependent objects to which it refers. When you configure
indirection (also known as lazy reading, lazy loading, and just-in-time
reading) for an attribute mapped with a relationship mapping,
EclipseLink uses an indirection object as a place holder for the
referenced object: EclipseLink defers reading the dependent object until
you access that specific attribute. This can result in a significant
performance improvement, especially if the application is interested
only in the contents of the retrieved object, rather than the objects to
which it is related.

Oracle strongly recommends using indirection for all relationship
mappings. Not only does this lets you optimize data source access, but
it also allows EclipseLink to optimize the persistence unit processing,
cache access, and concurrency.

[NOTE]
====
* The use of indirection is especially important for providing a proper
maintenance of bidirectional relationships. In this case, you must use
indirection. If you are operating with collections, you must use
transparent indirection (see link:#CEGGCCGA[Transparent Indirection]).
* The implementation of indirection (lazy loading) is vendor-specific.
Serializing entities and merging those entities back into a persistence
context may not be interoperable across vendors when lazy properties or
fields and/or relationships are used.
====

link:#i1102721[Figure 6-8] shows an indirection example. Without
indirection, reading the `Order` object also reads the dependent
collection of `LineItem` objects. With indirection, reading the `Order`
object does not read the dependent collection of `LineItem` objects: the
`lineItems` attribute refers to an indirection object. You can access
other attributes (such as `customerId`), but EclipseLink reads the
dependent `LineItem` objects only if and when you access the `lineItems`
attribute.

[[i1102721]][[OTLCG92106]]

*_Figure 6-8 EclipseLink Indirection_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/indirctn.png[Description of Figure 6-8 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-8 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/indirctn.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-8 EclipseLink Indirection"] +

EclipseLink supports the following types of indirection:

* link:#CEGHBHEA[Value Holder Indirection]
* link:#CEGGCCGA[Transparent Indirection]
* link:#CEGDCAIG[Proxy Indirection]

When using indirection with an object that your application serializes,
you must consider the effect of any untriggered indirection objects at
deserialization time. See link:#CHDEEIBD[Indirection, Serialization, and
Detachment].

[[CHDEEIBD]][[OTLCG92119]]

==== Indirection, Serialization, and Detachment

When using indirection (lazy loading), it is likely that a graph of
persistent objects will contain untriggered indirection objects. Because
indirection objects are transient and do not survive serialization
between one JVM and another, untriggered indirection objects will
trigger an error if the relationship is accessed after deserialization.

The application must ensure that any indirect relationships that will be
required after deserialization have been instantiated before
serialization. This can be done through accessing the get method for any
relationship using `ValueHolder` or weaved indirection, and by calling
the `size` method to any relationship using transparent indirection. If
the application desired the relationships to be always instantiated on
serialization, you could overwrite the serialization `writeObject`
method in the persistent class to first instantiate the desired
relationships. Use caution for objects with many or deep relationships
to avoid serializing large object graphs: ideally, only the
relationships required by the client should be instantiated.

When serializing JPA entities, any lazy relationships that have not been
instantiated prior to serialization will trigger errors if they are
accessed. If weaving is used on the server, and the entities are
serialized to a client, the same weaved classes must exist on the
client, either through static weaving of the jar, or through launching
the client JVM using the EclipseLink agent.

For more information, see link:app_dev002.htm#CCHGGAGE[Using Java
Byte-code Weaving].

[[CEGHBHEA]][[OTLCG92107]]

==== Value Holder Indirection

Persistent classes that use indirection must replace relationship
attributes with value holder attributes. A value holder is an instance
of a class that implements the `ValueHolderInterface` interface, such as
`ValueHolder`. This object stores the information necessary to retrieve
the object it is replacing from the database. If the application does
not access the value holder, the replaced object is never read from the
database.

To obtain the object that the value holder replaces, use the `getValue`
and `setValue` methods of the `ValueHolderInterface`. A convenient way
of using these methods is to hide the `getValue` and `setValue` methods
of the `ValueHolderInterface` inside `get` and `set` methods, as shown
in the following illustrations.

link:#i1102743[Figure 6-9] shows the `Employee` object being read from
the database. The `Address` object is not read and will not be created
unless it is accessed.

[[i1102743]][[OTLCG92108]]

*_Figure 6-9 Address Object Not Read_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/vhstep1.png[Description of Figure 6-9 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-9 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/vhstep1.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-9 Address Object Not Read"] +

The first time the address is accessed, as in link:#i1102751[Figure
6-10], the `ValueHolder` reads and returns the `Address` object.

[[i1102751]][[OTLCG92109]]

*_Figure 6-10 Initial Request_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/vhstep2.png[Description of Figure 6-10 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-10 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/vhstep2.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-10 Initial Request"] +

Subsequent requests for the address do not access the database, as shown
in link:#i1102759[Figure 6-11].

[[i1102759]][[OTLCG92110]]

*_Figure 6-11 Subsequent Requests_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/vhstep3.png[Description of Figure 6-11 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-11 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/vhstep3.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-11 Subsequent Requests"] +

If you are using method access, the get and set methods specified in the
mapping must access the instance of `ValueHolderInterface`, rather than
the object referenced by the value holder. The application should not
use these getter and setter, but use the getter and setter that hide the
usage of value holders.

[[CEGGCCGA]][[OTLCG92112]]

==== Transparent Indirection

Transparent indirection lets you declare any relationship attribute of a
persistent class that holds a collection of related objects as any of
the following Java objects:

* `java.util.Collection`
* `java.util.Hastable`
* `java.util.List`
* `java.util.Map`
* `java.util.Set`
* `java.util.Vector`

EclipseLink will use an indirection object that implements the
appropriate interface and also performs just-in-time reading of the
related objects. When using transparent indirection, you do not have to
declare the attributes as `ValueHolderInterface`.

Newly created collection mappings use transparent indirection by default
if their attribute _is not_ a `ValueHolderInterface`.

You can configure EclipseLink to automatically weave transparent
indirect container indirection for JPA entities and Plain Old Java
Object (POJO) classes. For more information, see
xref:{relativedir}/app_dev002.adoc#CCHGGAGE[Using Java Byte-code Weaving] and
xref:{relativedir}/app_dev005.adoc#APPDEV005[About Weaving.]

[[CEGDCAIG]][[OTLCG92114]]

==== Proxy Indirection

The Java class `Proxy` lets you use dynamic proxy objects as
place-holders for a defined interface. Certain EclipseLink mappings can
be configured to use proxy indirection, which gives you the benefits of
indirection without the need to include EclipseLink classes in your
domain model. Proxy indirection is to one-to-one relationship mappings
as indirect containers are to collection mappings.

To use proxy indirection, your domain model must satisfy all of the
following criteria:

* The target class of the one-to-one relationship must implement a
public interface.
* The one-to-one attribute on the source class must be of the
`interface` type.
* If you employ method accessing, then the getter and setter methods
must use the interface.

Before using proxy indirection, be aware of the restrictions it places
on how you use the persistence unit (see link:#CEGGDDJB[Proxy
Indirection Restrictions]).

To configure proxy indirection, you can use JDeveloper or Java in an
amendment method.

[[CEGGDDJB]][[OTLCG92115]]

===== Proxy Indirection Restrictions

Proxy objects in Java are only able to intercept messages sent. If a
primitive operation such as `==`, `instanceof`, or `getClass` is used on
a proxy, it will not be intercepted. This limitation can require the
application to be somewhat aware of the usage of proxy objects.

You cannot register the target of a proxy indirection implementation
with a persistence unit. Instead, first register the source object with
the persistence unit. This lets you retrieve a target object clone with
a call to a getter on the source object clone.

[[CHDBJGII]][[OTLCG92116]]

==== Weaved Indirection

For JPA entities or POJO classes that you configure for weaving,
EclipseLink weaves value holder indirection for one-to-one mappings. If
you want EclipseLink to weave change tracking and your application
includes collection mappings (one-to-many or many-to-many), then you
must configure all collection mappings to use transparent indirect
container indirection only (you may not configure your collection
mappings to use eager loading nor value holder indirection).

For more information, see xref:concepts/app_dev002.adoc#CCHGGAGE[Using Java Byte-code Weaving].

[[A7964325]][[OTLCG94305]]

==== About JPA Mapping Types

To map entity classes to relational tables you must configure a mapping
per persistent field. The following sections describe EclipeLink's JPA
mapping types:

* link:#CEGGDAJJ[Basic Mappings]
* link:#CEGJFEAH[Default Conversions and Converters]
* link:#CEGGABIA[Collection Mappings]
* link:#CEGDIIIB[Using Optimistic Locking]

[[CEGGDAJJ]][[OTLCG94306]]

===== Basic Mappings

Simple Java types are mapped as part of the immediate state of an entity
in its fields or properties. Mappings of simple Java types are called
basic mappings.

By default, the EclipseLink persistence provider automatically
configures a basic mapping for simple types.

Use the following annotations to fine-tune how your application
implements these mappings:

* `@Basic`
* `@Enumerated`
* `@Temporal`
* `@Lob`
* `@Transient`
* `@Column`
* Lazy Basics (See link:#CEGBCJAG[Using Indirection with Collections])

For all mapping types there are a common set of options:

* Read-Only: Specifies that the mapping should populate the value on
read and copy. Required when multiple mappings share the same database
column.
* Converters: Allows custom data types and data conversions to be used
with most mapping types
** Annotations: `@Converter`, `@TypeConverter`, `@ObjectTypeConverter`,
`@StructConverter`, `@Convert`
** External Metadata: `<converter>`, `<type-converter>`,
`<object-type-converter>`, `<struct-converter>`, `<convert>`

For more information on these annotations, see _Jakarta Persistence API
(JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[CEGJFEAH]][[OTLCG94307]]

===== Default Conversions and Converters

The section "Converter Annotations" in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)
Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_ provides a list of the converter
annotation extensions defined by EclipseLink and links to their
descriptions.

See the individual converter annotations in _Jakarta Persistence API
(JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_ for descriptions of the
following:

* the order in which the EclipseLink persistence provider searches the
converter annotations
* the types of classes for which you can specify converters (you can
define converters at the class, field and property level)
* the mappings with which you can use converters

[[CEGGABIA]][[OTLCG94308]]

===== Collection Mappings

You can access additional advanced mappings and mapping options through
the EclipseLink descriptor and mapping API using a
`DescriptorCustomizer` class.

* link:#CEGIGCIJ[One-to-Many Mapping]
* link:#CEGJCHEB[Many-to-Many Mapping]
* link:#CEGBCJAG[Using Indirection with Collections]

[[CEGIGCIJ]][[OTLCG94309]]

====== One-to-Many Mapping

One-to-many mappings are used to represent the relationship between a
single source object and a collection of target objects. They are a good
example of something that is simple to implement in Java using a
Collection (or other collection types) of target objects, but difficult
to implement using relational databases.

In a Java Collection, the owner references its parts. In a relational
database, the parts reference their owner. Relational databases use this
implementation to make querying more efficient.

[[OTLCG94310]][[sthref45]]

*_Figure 6-12 One-to-Many Relationships_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/onetomany_map_fig.png[This figure illustrates the one-to-many relationship.,title="This figure illustrates the one-to-many relationship."] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/onetomany_map_fig.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-12 One-to-Many Relationships"] +

NOTE: The phone attribute shown in the One-to-Many Relationships is of type
Vector. You can use a Collection interface (or any class that implements
the Collection interface) for declaring the collection attribute.

[[OTLCG94311]]

[[sthref47]]

====== JPA Mapping

By default, JPA automatically defines a OneToMany mapping for a
many-valued association with one-to-many multiplicity.

Use the `@OneToMany` annotation to do the following:

* configure the fetch type to `EAGER`
* configure the associated target entity, because the Collection used is
not defined using generics
* configure the operations that must be cascaded to the target of the
association: for example, if the owning entity is removed, ensure that
the target of the association is also removed
* configure the details of the join table used by the persistence
provider for unidirectional one-to-many relationships. For a one-to-many
using a `mappedBy` or `JoinColumn`, the deletion of the related objects
is cascaded on the database. For a one-to-many using a `JoinTable`, the
deletion of the join table is cascaded on the database (target objects
cannot be cascaded even if private because of constraint direction).

For more information, see Section 11.1.23 "JoinTable Annotation" in the
JPA Specification.

`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`

[[CEGJCHEB]][[OTLCG94312]]

====== Many-to-Many Mapping

Many-to-many mappings represent the relationships between a collection
of source objects and a collection of target objects. They require the
creation of an intermediate table for managing the associations between
the source and target records.

link:#CEGIHDED[Figure 6-13] illustrates a many-to-many mapping in Java
and in relational database tables.

[[CEGIHDED]][[OTLCG94313]]

*_Figure 6-13 Many-to-Many Relationships_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/mmmapfig.png[Many-to-many Relationships,title="Many-to-many Relationships"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/mmmapfig.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-13 Many-to-Many Relationships"] +

NOTE: For the projects attribute shown in the Many-to-many Relationships you
can use a `Collection` interface (or any class that implements the
`Collection` interface) for declaring the collection attribute.

[[CEGFEIFF]][[OTLCG94314]]

====== JPA Mapping

By default, JPA automatically defines a many-to-many mapping for a
many-valued association with many-to-many multiplicity.

Use the `@ManyToMany` annotation to do the following:

* configure the `FetchType` to `EAGER`
* configure the mapping to forbid null values (for nonprimitive types)
in case null values are inappropriate for your application
* configure the associated target entity because the Collection used is
not defined using generics
* configure the operations that must be cascaded to the target of the
association (for example, if the owning entity is removed, ensure that
the target of the association is also removed)

For a list of supported attributes for the `@ManyToMany` annotation, see
the Java Persistence specification:

`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`

[[CEGBCJAG]][[OTLCG94303]]

====== Using Indirection with Collections

JPA specifies that lazy loading is a hint to the persistence provider
that data should be fetched lazily when it is first accessed, if
possible. If you are developing your application in a Jakarta EE
environment, set fetch to `jakarta.persistence.FetchType.LAZY`, and the
persistence provider supplies all the necessary functionality.

When using a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping in a Java SE environment,
use either dynamic or static weaving to perform lazy loading when the
`fetch` attribute is set to `FetchType.LAZY`. Also in the Java SE
environment, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships are lazy by
default and use transparent indirection, while one-to-one and
many-to-one relationships are not lazy.

When using a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping in a Java SE environment
and the environment does not permit the use of `-javaagent` on the JVM
command line, use static weaving to perform lazy loading when the
`fetch` attribute is set to `FetchType.LAZY`.

If you set one-to-one or many-to-one relationships to lazy, and you
enable weaving, the EclipseLink JPA persistence provider will use
weaving to enable value holder indirection for these relationships.

The collection annotations `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`, and
`@ManyToOne` provide a `fetch` mapping attribute which can be set to
`lazy` or `eager`. When you set the attribute to `lazy`, the EclipseLink
JPA persistence provider uses indirection.

link:#CEGCJEHD[Table 6-1] lists support for lazy loading by mapping
type.

[[OTLCG94304]][[sthref49]][[CEGCJEHD]]

|=======================================================================

[[CEGDIIIB]][[OTLCG94315]]

===== Using Optimistic Locking

Oracle recommends using optimistic locking. With optimistic locking, all
users have read access to the data. When a user attempts to write a
change, the application checks to ensure the data has not changed since
the user read the data.

[[OTLCG94317]]

[[sthref50]]

====== Optimistic Locking in a Stateless Environment

In a stateless environment, take care to avoid processing out-of-date
(stale) data. A common strategy for avoiding stale data is to implement
optimistic locking, and store the optimistic lock values in the object.
This solution requires careful implementation if the stateless
application serializes the objects, or sends the contents of the object
to the client in an alternative format. In this case, transport the
optimistic lock values to the client in the HTTP contents of an edit
page. You must then use the returned values in any write transaction to
ensure that the data did not change while the client was performing its
work.

You can use optimistic version locking or optimistic field locking
policies. Oracle recommends using version locking policies.

[[OTLCG94318]]

[[sthref51]]

====== Optimistic Version Locking

Use the `@Version` annotation to enable the JPA-managed optimistic
locking by specifying the version field or property of an entity class
that serves as its optimistic lock value (recommended).

When choosing a version field or property, ensure that the following is
true:

* there is only one version field or property per entity
* you choose a property or field persisted to the primary table
* your application does not modify the version property or field

For more information, see Section 11.1.45 "Table Annotation" in the JPA
Specification.

`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`

 NOTE: The field or property type must either be a numeric type (such as
`Number`, `long`, `int`, `BigDecimal`, and so on), or a
`java.sql.Timestamp`. EclipseLink recommends using a numeric type.


The `@Version` annotation does not have attributes. The `@Version`
annotation allows you to use EclipseLink converters. See
link:#CEGJFEAH[Default Conversions and Converters.]

For more information, see Section 11.1.9 "Column Annotation" in the JPA
Specification.

`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`
