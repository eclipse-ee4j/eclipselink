=== About the Object-Relational Solution

EclipseLink provides a complete, JPA-compliant JPA implementation. It
provides complete compliance for all of the mandatory features and many
of the optional features. It also supports EclipseLink features not
described in the JPA specification, such as object-level cache,
distributed cache coordination, extensive performance tuning options,
enhanced Oracle Database support, advanced mappings, optimistic and
pessimistic locking options, extended annotations, and query hints.

For more information, see _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions
Reference for EclipseLink_.

The following sections describe many of these features.

==== Understanding Object-Relational Entity Architecture

The entity architecture is composed of entities, persistence units,
persistence contexts, entity manager factories, and entity managers.
link:#CHDHABEI[Figure 2-2] illustrates the relationships between these
elements:

* Persistence creates one or more `EntityManagerFactory` objects.
* Each `EntityManagerFactory` is configured by one persistence unit.
* `EntityManagerFactory` creates one or more `EntityManager` objects.
* One or more `EntityManagers` manage one `PersistenceContext`.

===== Entities

An entity is any application-defined object with the following
characteristics:

* It can be made persistent.
* It has a persistent identity (a key that uniquely identifies an entity
instance and distinguishes it from other instances of the same entity
type. An entity has a persistent identity when there is a representation
of it in a data store).
* It is transactional in a sense that a _persistence_ _view_ of an
entity is transactional (an entity is created, updated, and deleted
within a transaction, and a transaction is required for the changes to
be committed in the database). However, in-memory entities can be
changed without the changes being persisted.
* It is _not_ a primitive, a primitive wrapper, or built-in object. An
entity is a fine-grained object that has a set of aggregated states that
is typically stored in a single place (such as a row in a table) and
have relationships to other entities.

The entity also contains entity metadata that describes the entity.
Entity metadata is not persisted to the database. It is used by the
persistence layer to manage the entity from when it is loaded until it
is invoked at runtime. Metadata can be expressed as annotations on the
Java programming elements or in XML files (descriptors). For more
information, see link:entities.htm#CIHGAJCF[Chapter 4, "Understanding
Entities."]

Beginning with the current release, you can define and use extensible
entities where mappings can be added spontaneously. In this case, the
entity stores extended attributes within a map instead of static
attributes. The entity then defines how values from this map are mapped
to the database using an `eclipselink-orm.xml` mapping file. In addition
to being able to dynamically define mappings, EclipseLink also enables
these extended mappings to be stored and managed externally. This
external storage enables your extended mappings to be defined while the
application is running. For more information on making entities
extensible, see "Providing Software as a Service" in _Solutions Guide
for EclipseLink_.

===== Persistence and Persistence Units

Persistence is a characteristic of an entity. This means that the entity
can be represented in a data store, and it can be accessed at a later
time.

A persistence unit identifies a persistable unit and defines the
properties associated with it. It also defines the objects that must be
persisted. The objects can be entity classes, embeddable classes, or
mapped superclasses. The persistence unit provides the configuration for
the entity manager factory. Entity managers created by the entity
manager factory inherit the properties defined in the persistence unit.

[[OTLCG140]]

[[sthref16]]

===== Entity Managers

An entity manager enables API calls to perform operations on an entity.
Until an entity manager is used to create, read, or write an entity, the
entity is a nonpersistent Java object. When an entity manager obtains a
reference to an entity, that entity becomes managed by the entity
manager. The set of managed entity instances within an entity manager at
any given time is called its persistence context; only one Java instance
with the same persistent identity can exist in a persistence context at
any time.

You can configure an entity manager to read or write to a particular
database, to persist or manage certain types of objects, and to be
implemented by a specific persistence provider. The persistence provider
supplies the implementation for JPA, including the `EntityManager`
interface implementation, the Query implementation, and the SQL
generation.Entity managers are provided by an `EntityManagerFactory`.
The configuration for an entity manager is bound to the
`EntityManagerFactory`, but it is defined separately as a persistence
unit. You name persistence units to enable differentiation between
`EntityManagerFactory` objects. This way, your application obtains
control over which configuration to use for operations on a specific
entity. The configuration that describes the persistence unit is defined
in a `persistence.xml` file. You name persistence units to be able to
request a specific configuration to be bound to an
`EntityManagerFactory`.

[[CHDIADII]][[OTLCG141]]

==== Adding Metadata Using Annotations

An annotation is a simple, expressive means of decorating Java source
code with metadata that is compiled into the corresponding Java class
files for interpretation at run time by a JPA persistence provider to
manage persistent behavior.

A metadata annotation represents a Java language feature that lets you
attach structured and typed metadata to the source code. Annotations
alone are sufficient for the metadata specification—you do not need to
use XML. Standard JPA annotations are in the `jakarta.persistence`
package.

For more information, see Chapter 10 "Metadata Annotations" in the JPA
Specification `http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`

EclipseLink provides a set of proprietary annotations as an easy way to
add metadata to the Java source code. The metadata is compiled into the
corresponding Java class files for interpretation at run time by a JPA
persistence provider to manage persistent behavior. You can apply
annotations at the class, method, and field levels.

EclipseLink annotations expose some features that are currently not
available through the use of JPA metadata:

* Basic properties—By default, the EclipseLink persistence provider
automatically configures a basic mapping for simple types. Use these
annotations to fine-tune the immediate state of an entity in its fields
or properties.
* Relationships—EclipseLink has defaults for some relationships, such as
One-To-One and One-To-Many. Other relationships must be mapped
explicitly. Use the annotations to specify the type and characteristics
of entity relationships and to fine-tune how your database implements
these relationships.
* Embedded objects—An embedded object does not have its own persistent
identity; it is dependent upon an entity for its identity. By default,
the persistence provider assumes that every entity is mapped to its own
table. Use annotations to override this behavior for entities that are
owned by other entities.

[[OTLCG94267]]

[[sthref17]]

===== Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Annotations

Using annotations provides several advantages:

* They are relatively simple to use and understand.
* They provide in-line metadata within with the code that it describes;
you do not need to replicate the source code context of where the
metadata applies.

The primary disadvantage of annotations is that the metatdata becomes
unnecessarily coupled to the code; changes to metadata require changing
and recompiling the source code.

[[CHDIEIFJ]][[OTLCG142]]

==== About Configuration Basics

The following sections describe some of the key configuration files in
an Object Relational Mapping project.

[[OTLCG143]]

[[sthref18]]

===== Default Annotation Values

Each annotation has a default value (consult the JPA specification for
defaults). A persistence engine defines defaults that apply to the
majority of applications. You only need to supply values when you want
to override the default value. Therefore, having to supply a
configuration value is not a requirement, but the exception to the rule.
This is known as configuration by exception.

NOTE: You should be familiar with the defaults to be able to change the
behavior when necessary.

The default values are described in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)
Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_. See also Chapter 10, "Metadata
Annotations" in the JPA specification.

`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`

The configuration is done by exception: if a value is _not_ specified in
one of the configuration files, then a default value is used.

[[OTLCG144]]

[[sthref19]]

===== Configuring Persistence Units Using persistence.xml

A persistence unit defines the details that are required when you
acquire an entity manager. You specify a persistence unit by name when
you acquire an entity manager factory. Use the JPA persistence file,
`persistence.xml`, to configure a persistence unit. You can specify any
vendor-specific extensions in the file by using a `<properties>`
element.

This file appears in the `META-INF`/ directory of your persistence unit
JAR file or in the classpath.

For more information, see link:app_dev001.htm#BABHCJDG[About the
Persistence Unit.] See also "Persistence Property Extensions Reference"
in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[CHDFGGBB]][[OTLCG130]]

===== Object-Relational Data Type Mappings

Object-relational data type mappings transform certain object data
member types to structured data source representations optimized for
storage in specialized object-relational databases such as Oracle
Database. Object-relational data type mappings let you map an object
model into an object-relational model. You can use only
object-relational data type mappings with specialized object-relational
databases optimized to support object-relational data type data source
representations.

For more information, see _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions
Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[CHDFFBHD]][[OTLCG146]]

==== About Data Sources

An important part of the definition of the persistence unit is the
location where the provider can find data to read and write. This is
called the *data* *source*. The data source is typically a database. The
database location is specified in the form of a JDBC data source in the
JNDI namespace of the server.

Typically, applications that use EclipseLink are run in the context of a
JTA transaction. Specify the name of the data source in the
`jta-data-source` element in the `persistence.xml` file. If the
application is not run in the context of a transaction, then it is
considered to be _resource-local_. In this case, specify the name of the
data source in the `non-jta-data-source` element.

You can also specify a non-relational database data source, such as an
XML schema.

For more information, see link:data_access.htm#CHDJBDEA[Chapter 7,
"Understanding Data Access."]

Applications can be run in standalone, or _Java SE_, mode. In this mode,
the application runs outside the server, with a non-JTA compliant data
source, and in a non-Oracle stack. In this case, you must provide
driver-specific information, such as the JDBC driver class, the URL that
the client uses to connect to the database, and the user name and
password to access the database. For more information and an example of
running an application in standalone mode, see "Testing EclipseLink JPA
Outside a Container" in _Solutions Guide for EclipseLink_.

[[CHDGGEID]][[OTLCG147]]

==== About EclipseLink Caches

By default, EclipseLink uses a shared object cache that caches a subset
of all objects read and persisted for the persistence unit. The shared
cache differs from the local `EntityManager` cache. The shared cache
exists for the duration of the persistence unit (`EntityManagerFactory`
or server) and is shared by all `EntityManagers` and users of the
persistence unit. The local `EntityManager` cache is not shared and only
exists for the duration of the `EntityManager` or transaction.

The benefit of the shared cache is that after an object is read, the
database does not need to be accessed if the object is read again. Also,
if the object is read by using a query, it does not need to be rebuilt,
and its relationships do not need to be fetched again.

The limitation of the shared cache is that if the database is changed
directly through JDBC, or by another application or server, the objects
in the shared cache will be stale.

EclipseLink offers several mechanism to deal with stale data including:

* Refreshing
* Invalidation
* Optimistic locking
* Cache coordination
* Database Change Notification (DCN)

The shared cache can also be disabled, or it can be selectively enabled
and disabled by using the `@Cache` or `@Cacheable`
annotations.EclipseLink also offers several different caching
strategies, to configure how many objects are cached and how much memory
is used.

If the application detects that the cache is out of date, it can clear,
refresh, or invalidate it programmatically. Clearing the cache can cause
object identity issues if any of the cached objects are in use, so
invalidating is safer. If you know that none of the cached objects are
in use, then you can clear the cache.

For more information, see xref:{relativedir}/cache.adoc#CACHE[Chapter 8,
"Understanding Caching."]

[[OTLCG148]]

[[sthref20]]

===== Defining Cache Behavior

EclipseLink provides an `@Cache` annotation which lets you define cache
properties. The properties include cache type, size, and refresh rules,
among others. See _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference
for EclipseLink_.

[[OTLCG149]]

[[sthref21]]

===== Caching in Clustered Environments

Caching in a clustered environment can have problems because changes
made on one server are not reflected on objects cached in other servers.
This is not a problem for read-only objects, but it is for objects that
are frequently updated.

EclipseLink offers several solutions to this problem.

* The cache can be disabled for the classes that frequently change.
* Cache coordination can be used to broadcast changes between the
servers in the cluster to update or invalidate changed objects.
* Cache invalidation based on time-to-live or time-of-day.
* Optimistic locking prevents updates to stale objects and triggers the
objects to be invalidated in the cache.

For more information, see link:cache010.htm#CDEGDGAA[Clustering and
Cache Coordination].

[[CHDFGCJB]][[OTLCG150]]

queries.

* JPQL queries
* SQL queries
* Criteria API queries
* Native SQL queries
* EclipseLink JPA query hints
* Query casting
* Oracle Extensions for queries
