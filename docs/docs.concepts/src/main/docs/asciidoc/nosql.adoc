==  Understanding Non-relational Data Sources

This chapter describes how to set up your JPA applications to work with
a non-relational data source. There are many types of non-relational
data sources. These include document databases, key-value stores, and
various other non-standard databases, such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and
Google BigTable. This chapter focuses on the NoSQL data source. NoSQL is
a classification of database systems that do not support the SQL
standard. EclipseLink supports persistence of Java objects to NoSQL
databases through the Jakarta Persistence API (JPA). EclipseLink native
API is also supported with NoSQL databases.

This chapter includes the following sections:
