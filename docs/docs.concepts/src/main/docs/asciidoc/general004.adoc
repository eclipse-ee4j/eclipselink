==== EclipseLink Core and API

The EclipseLink Core provides the runtime component. Access to the
runtime can be obtained directly through the EclipseLink API. The
runtime environment is not a separate or external process—it is embedded
within the application. Application calls invoke EclipseLink to provide
persistence behavior. This function enables transactional and
thread-safe access to shared database connections and cached objects.

The EclipseLink API provides the reference implementation for JPA 2.0
(JSR-338). The `org.eclipse.persistence.*` classes encapsulate the
EclipseLink API and provide extensions beyond the specification. These
extensions include EclipseLink-specific properties and annotations. For
more information on the API, properties and extensions, see _Jakarta
Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

The JAXB APIs are included in Java SE 6. In the `eclipselink.jar` file,
the `org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.*` classes encapsulate the EclipseLink
support for JAXB.

==== Object-Relational (JPA 2.2) Component

JPA simplifies Java persistence. It provides an object-relational
mapping approach that lets you declaratively define how to map Java
objects to relational database tables in a standard, portable way. JPA
works both inside a Jakarta EE application server and outside an EJB
container in a Java Standard Edition (Java SE) application. The main
features included in the 2.2 JPA update are:

* Expanded object/relational mapping functionality
** Support for collections of embedded objects
** Multiple levels of embedded objects
** Ordered lists
** Combinations of access types
* A criteria query API
* Standardization of query "hints"
* Standardization of additional metadata to support DDL generation
* Support for validation

==== JAXB Component

JAXB is a Java API that allows a Java program to access an XML document
by presenting that document to the program in a Java format. This
process, called binding, represents information in an XML document as an
object in computer memory. In this way, applications can access the data
in the XML from the object rather than using the Domain Object Model
(DOM) or the Streaming API for XML (SAX) to retrieve the data from a
direct representation of the XML itself. Usually, an XML binding is used
with JPA entities to create a data access service by leveraging a JAX-WS
or JAX-RS implementation. Both of these Web Service standards use JAXB
as the default binding layer. This service provides a means to access
data exposed by JPA across computers, where the client computer might or
might not be using Java.

JAXB uses an extended set of annotations to define the binding rules for
Java-to-XML mapping. These annotations are subclasses of the
`jakarta.xml.bind.`__`*`__ packages in the EclipseLink API. For more
information about these annotations, see _Java API Reference for
EclipseLink_.

For more information about JAXB, see "Java Architecture for XML Binding
(JAXB)" at:

`http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/moxy.php`

==== MOXy Component

_MOXy_ (also known as Object-XML) is the EclipseLink JAXB
implementation. This component enables you to bind Java classes to XML
schemas. MOXy implements JAXB which lets you provide mapping information
through annotations. Support for storing the mappings in XML format is
provided by MOXy. The many advanced mappings that are available enable
you to handle complex XML structures without having to mirror the schema
in your Java class model.

The objects produced by the EclipseLink JAXB compiler are Java POJO
models. They are generated with the necessary annotations required by
the JAXB specification. The JAXB runtime API can be used to marshal and
unmarshal objects.

When using MOXy as the JAXB provider, no metadata is required to convert
your existing object model to XML. You can supply metadata (using
annotations or XML) only when you must fine-tune the XML representation
of the model.

Using EclipseLink MOXy, you can manipulate XML in the following ways:

* Generate a Java Model from an XML schema
* Specify the EclipseLink MOXy JAXB runtime
* Use JAXB to manipulate XML
* Generate an XML schema from a Java model

For more information on MOXy and these use cases, see _Developing JAXB
Applications EclipseLink MOXy_.

EclipseLink provides maximum flexibility with the ability to control how
your object model is mapped to an XML schema. There are many advantages
to having control over your own object model:

* You can design the domain classes specifically for your application
using the appropriate patterns and practices.
* You can use XPath-based mapping. This prevents the need for having a
1-to-1 relationship between classes and XML schema types. For more
information, see _Developing JAXB Applications EclipseLink MOXy_.
* You can instantiate objects in a way that is appropriate to your
application.
* You can control your own class path dependencies. Most JAXB
implementations put vendor specific code in the generated classes that
add class path dependencies to your application.

One of the key advantages of EclipseLink is that the mapping information
can be stored externally and does not require any changes to the Java
classes or XML schema. This means that you can map your domain objects
to more than one schema, or if your schema changes, you can update the
mapping metadata instead of modifying your domain classes. This is also
useful when mapping third-party classes, because you might not have
access to the source to add annotations.

==== SDO Component

The Service Data Objects (SDO) component provides the reference
implementation of Service Data Objects version 2.1.1. The reference
implementation is described in http://jcp.org/en/home/index[JSR-235].
The SDO implementation incorporates the reference implementation and
provides additional features primarily used for converting Java objects
to XML, and for building and using data object models that can be
incorporated into service architectures.

SDO provides you with the following capabilities:

* Use of the SDO APIs
* Conversion an XML Schema
* Customization of your XSD for SDO usage
* Use of dynamic data objects to manipulate XML
* Use of static data objects
** Run the SDO compiler—generate type safe data objects
** Use type safe data objects to manipulate XML

For more information, see "Getting Started with EclipseLink SDO" in the
EclipseLink documentation:

`http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/moxy.php`

==== Database Web Services Component

Database Web Services (DBWS) enables simple and efficient access to
relational database artifacts by using a web service. It provides
Jakarta EE-compliant client-neutral access to the database without
having to write Java code. DBWS extends EclipseLink's core capabilities
while using existing ORM and OXM components.

DBWS has a runtime provider component that takes a service descriptor
(along with related deployment artifacts) and realizes it as a JAX-WS
2.0 Web service. The runtime provider uses EclipseLink to bridge between
the database and the XML SOAP Messages used by web service clients. For
information on DBWS architecture, see _Developing Persistence
Architectures Using EclipseLink Database Web Services Developer's
Guide_.
