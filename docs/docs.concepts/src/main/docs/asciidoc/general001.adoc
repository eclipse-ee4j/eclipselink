=== Understanding EclipseLink

EclipseLink is an open-source mapping and persistence framework for use
in a Java environment, including Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java
SE) and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE). The EclipseLink
project is under the stewardship of the Eclipse Foundation.

EclipseLink completely implements the following specifications, plus
extensions to those specifications:

* *Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)*
+
JPA is the Java API for object/relational mapping (ORM), where Java
objects are mapped to database artifacts, for the purpose of managing
relational data in Java applications. JPA includes Java Persistence
Query Language (JPQL), the Java Persistence Criteria API, and the Java
API and XML schema for defining object/relational mapping metadata.
+
The latest version of the specification is _JSR 338: Java Persistence
2.2_. See `http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338`.
+
Some of the EclipseLink extensions to standard JPA are:
** Support for mapping to nonrelational (NoSQL) databases.
** Features useful in Software as a Service (SaaS) environments,
including tenant isolation, extensible entities, external metadata
sources.
** Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS, defined in JSR 311).
** Many other additional annotations, annotation extensions, Java
Persistence Query Language (JPQL) extensions, JPA query customizations
extensions, and persistence property extensions.
* *Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)*
+
JAXB is the Java API for object/XML mapping (OXM), where an XML document
is bound to Java objects, based on the XML document's XSD schema. JAXB
provides methods for unmarshalling (reading) XML instance documents into
Java content trees, and then marshalling (writing) Java content trees
back into XML instance documents. JAXB also provides a way to generate
XML schema from Java objects.
+
The latest version of the specification is _JSR 222: Java Architecture
for XML Binding (JAXB) 2.0_. See `http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=222`.


NOTE: The EclipseLink JAXB implementation is part of the *EclipseLink MOXy*
component, which extends EclipseLink JAXB to support JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) documents. EclipseLink supports all object/XML options
when reading and writing JSON. MOXy also includes support for the older
native EclipseLink object/XML API).

In addition to the implementations of the standard specifications
described above, EclipseLink includes the following:

* *EclipseLink Database Web Services (DBWS)*
+
DBWS is a development tool and a runtime for providing Jakarta
EE-compliant, client-neutral access to relational database artifacts via
a Web service. The development tool, DBWS Builder, is a command-line
utility that generates the necessary deployment artifacts. (DBWS Builder
is integrated into the Eclipse Dali Java Persistence toolset and into
Oracle JDeveloper.) The runtime provider takes a service descriptor
(along with related deployment artifacts) and realizes it as a JAX-WS
2.0 Web service. The runtime uses EclipseLink to bridge between the
database and the XML SOAP Messages used by Web service clients.
* *EclipseLink Enterprise Information Services (EIS)*
+
EIS is a facility for enabling the use of data stores through Java
Connector Architecture (JCA) resource adapters. Using XML metadata, the
interactions and their exchanged data are configured and mapped onto a
domain model. The interactions data can be mapped from either the Common
Client interface (CCI) or using XML schemas. This use is intended for
non-relational data stores where no JDBC or SQL access is provided.

EclipseLink can be used with a wide range of Java Enterprise Edition
(Jakarta EE) and Java application architectures. Use EclipseLink to
design, implement, deploy, and optimize an advanced, object-persistence
and object-transformation layer that supports a variety of data sources
and formats, including relational databases, nonrelational (NoSQL)
databases, XML, JSON, and Web Services.

EclipseLink supports Java persistence in Jakarta EE, Java SE and web
containers including integration with various application servers
including:

* Oracle WebLogic Server
* Oracle Glassfish Server
* JBoss Web Server
* IBM WebSphere application server
* SAP NetWeaver
* Oracle Containers for Jakarta EE (OC4J)
* Various other web containers, such as Apache Tomcat, Eclipse Gemini,
IBM WebSphere CE, and SpringSource Server

EclipseLink lets you quickly capture and define object-to-data source
and object-to-data representation mappings in a flexible, efficient
metadata format.

The runtime lets your application exploit this mapping metadata with a
simple session facade that provides in-depth support for data access,
queries, transactions (both with and without an external transaction
controller), and caching.

==== What Is the Object-Persistence Impedance Mismatch?

Java-to-data source integration is a widely underestimated problem when
creating enterprise Java applications. This complex problem involves
more than simply reading from and writing to a data source. The data
source elements include tables, rows, columns, and primary and foreign
keys. The Java and Jakarta EE programming languages include entity
classes (regular Java classes), business rules, complex relationships,
and inheritance. In a nonrelational data source, you must match your
Java entities with XML elements and schemas.

A successful solution requires bridging these different technologies and
solving the object-persistence impedance mismatchâ€”a challenging and
resource-intensive problem. To solve this problem, you must resolve the
following issues between Jakarta EE and the data source elements:

* Fundamentally different technologies
* Different skill sets
* Different staff and ownership for each of the technologies
* Different modeling and design principles

As an application developer, you need a product that lets you integrate
Java applications with any data source, without compromising application
design or data integrity. In addition, as a Java developer, you need the
ability to store (that is, persist) and retrieve business domain objects
using a relational database or a nonrelational data source as a
repository.

==== The EclipseLink Solution

EclipseLink addresses the disparity between Java objects and data
sources. It contains a persistence framework that lets you build
applications that combine the best aspects of object technology with a
specific data source. You can do the following:

* Persist Java objects to virtually any relational database
* Perform in-memory conversions between Java objects and XML and JSON
documents
* Map any object model to any relational or nonrelational schema
* Use EclipseLink successfully, even if you are unfamiliar with SQL or
JDBC, because EclipseLink offers a clear, object-oriented view of data
sources
