=== Common Mapping Concepts

This section describes concepts for relational and nonrelational
mappings that are unique to EclipseLink:

[[CHDEDGDF]][[OTLCG92097]]

==== Mapping Architecture

To define a mapping, you draw upon the following components:

* The data representation specific to the data source (such as a
relational database table or schema-defined XML element) in which you
store the object's data.
* A descriptor for a particular object class.
* An object class to map.

NOTE: A mapping is the same regardless of whether your project is persistent
or nonpersistent.

For an example of a typical EclipseLink mapping, see
link:#CHDGGFCH[Mapping Examples].

The type of data source you define in your project determines the type
of mappings you can use and how you configure them. In a persistent
project, you use mappings to persist to a data source. In a
nonpersistent project, you use mappings simply to transform between the
object format and some other data representation (such as XML).

A descriptor represents a particular domain object: it describes the
object's class. A descriptor also owns the mappings: one mapping for
each of the class data members that you intend to persist or transform
in memory. For more information about descriptors, see
link:descriptors.htm#CHECEAAE[Chapter 5, "Understanding Descriptors"].

[[CHDGGFCH]][[OTLCG92098]]

==== Mapping Examples

Although EclipseLink supports more complex mappings, most EclipseLink
classes map to a single database table or XML element that defines the
type of information available in the class. Each object instance of a
given class maps to a single row comprising the object's attributes,
plus an identifier (the primary key) that uniquely identifies the
object.

link:#CHDHADEG[Figure 6-1] illustrates the simplest database mapping
case in which:

* *Table_X* in the database represents *Class_X*.
* *Object_X1* and *Object_X2* are instances of *Class_X*.
* Individual rows in *Table_X* represent *Object_X1* and *Object_X2*, as
well as any other instances of *Class_X*.

xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/example_map1.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-1 How Classes and Objects Map to a Database Table"] +

EclipseLink provides you with the tools to build these mappings, from
the simple mappings illustrated in link:#CHDHADEG[Figure 6-1], to
complex mappings.

For an additional example of a relational mapping, see
link:#i1025794[Figure 6-2, "Serialized Object Converter (relational)"].

[[CHDJJHJD]][[OTLCG92121]]

==== Mapping Converters

If existing EclipseLink mappings do not meet your needs, you can create
custom mappings using mapping extensions. These extensions include the
following:

* link:#BABHCBJA[Serialized Object Converter]
* link:#BABEHFGH[Type Conversion Converter]
* link:#BABBCAIH[Object Type Converter]

NOTE: Except for simple type translation, you can use the mapping converters
and transformers regardless of whether your data source is relational or
nonrelational. Simple type translation is applicable only to XML
projects.

[[BABHCBJA]][[OTLCG00042]]

===== Serialized Object Converter

The serialized object converter can be used with direct and direct
collection mappings, allowing you to map complex objects into binary
fields through Java object serialization. Serialized objects are
normally stored in `RAW` or Binary Large Object (`BLOB)` fields in the
database, or `HEX` or `BASE64` elements in an XML document.

link:#i1025794[Figure 6-2] shows an example of a direct-to-field
mappings that uses a serialized object converter. The attribute
`jobDescription` contains a formatted text document that is stored in
the `JOB_DESC` field of the database.

[[i1025794]][[OTLCG92122]]

*_Figure 6-2 Serialized Object Converter (relational)_*

xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/serobjfg.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-2 Serialized Object Converter (relational)"] +

link:#CEGGDDEC[Figure 6-3] demonstrates an example of a nonrelational
mapping that uses a serialized object converter. The attribute
`jobDescription` contains a formatted text document that EclipseLink
stores in the `JOB DESCRIPTION` element of an XML schema.

[[CEGGDDEC]][[OTLCG92123]]

*_Figure 6-3 Serialized Object Converter (nonrelational)_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/otlcg_dt_002.png[Description of Figure 6-3 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-3 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/otlcg_dt_002.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-3 Serialized Object Converter (nonrelational)"] +

The serialized object converter relies on the Java serializer. Before
you map a domain object with the serialized object converter, ensure
that the domain object implements the `java.io.Serializable` interface
(or inherits that implementation) and marks all nonserializable fields
transient.

[[BABEHFGH]][[OTLCG00043]]

===== Type Conversion Converter

The type conversion converter can be used with direct and direct
collection mappings, allowing you to map complex objects into binary
fields. For example, a `Number` in the data source can be mapped to a
`String` in Java, or a `java.util.Date` in Java can be mapped to a
`java.sql.Date` in the data source.

link:#i1054818[Figure 6-4] illustrates a type conversion mapping
(relational). Because the `java.util.Date` class is stored by default as
a `Timestamp` in the database, it must first be converted to an explicit
database type such as `java.sql.Date` (required only for DB2â€“most other
databases have a single date data type that can store any date or time).

[[i1054818]][[OTLCG92124]]

*_Figure 6-4 Type Conversion Mapping (relational)_*

xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/tcmapfig.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-4 Type Conversion Mapping (relational) "] +

link:#CHDBJHEI[Figure 6-5] illustrates a type conversion mapping
(nonrelational). `java.util.Date` object is mapped to a String in a XML
schema.

[[CHDBJHEI]][[OTLCG92125]]

*_Figure 6-5 Type Conversion Mapping (nonrelational)_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/tcmapxml.png[Description of Figure 6-5 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-5 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/tcmapxml.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-5 Type Conversion Mapping (nonrelational)"] +

You can use a type conversion converter to specify the specific database
type when that type must be handled specially for the database. This
includes support for the special Oracle JDBC binding options required
for `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, and `NCLOB` fields as well as the special
Oracle Thin JDBC insert and update requirements for handling `BLOB` and
`CLOB` fields greater than 5K.

EclipseLink uses the `NCharacter`, `NClob` and `NString` types in the
`org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.oracle` package as the
converter data type to support the `NCHAR`, `NCLOB` and `NVARCHAR2`
types. EclipseLink uses the `java.sql.Blob` and `Clob` types as the
converter data type to support `BLOB` and `CLOB` values greater than 5K.

You can configure a type conversion converter to map a data source time
type (such as `TIMESTAMP`) to a `java.lang.String` provided that the
String value conforms to the following formats:

* `YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS`
* `YY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS`
* `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
* `YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`

For more complex `String` to `TIMESTAMP` type conversion, consider a
transformation mapping (see link:#CHDDBJJJ[Transformation Mapping]).

You can also use the `@TypeConverter` annotation to modify data values
during the reading and writing of a mapped attribute. Each
`TypeConverter` must be uniquely named and can be defined at the class,
field, and property level, and can be specified within an `Entity`,
`MappedSuperclass` and `Embeddable` class. A `TypeConverter` is always
specified by using an `@Convert` annotation.

You can place a `@TypeConverter` on a `Basic`, `BasicMap`, or
`BasicCollection` mapping. For more information on these annotations,
see _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for
EclipseLink_.

[[BABBCAIH]][[OTLCG00044]]

===== Object Type Converter

The object type converter can be used with direct and direct collection
mappings allowing you to match a fixed number of values to Java objects.
Use this converter when the values in the schema differ from those in
Java.

link:#CHDJBFJH[Figure 6-6] illustrates an object type conversion between
the `Employee` attribute `gender` and the XML element `gender`. If the
value of the Java object attribute is `Female`, EclipseLink stores it in
the XML element as `F`.

[[CHDJBFJH]][[OTLCG92126]]

*_Figure 6-6 Object Type XML Converter_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/obxmlfig.png[Description of Figure 6-6 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-6 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/obxmlfig.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-6 Object Type XML Converter"] +

You can also perform object type transformations by using the
`@ObjectTypeConverter` annotation. This annotation specifies an
`org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.converters.ObjectTypeConverter` that
converts a fixed number of database data value(s) to Java object
value(s) during the reading and writing of a mapped attribute. For this
annotation you must provide values for the array of conversion values by
using the `@ConversionValue` annotation. For more information, see the
descriptions of `@ObjectTypeConverter` and `@ConversionValue` in
_Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions Reference for EclipseLink_.

[[CHDDBJJJ]][[OTLCG00040]]

==== Transformation Mapping

In some special circumstances, existing mapping types and their default
Java to data source type handling may be insufficient. In these special
cases, you can consider using a transformation mapping to perform
specialized translations between how a value is represented in Java and
in the data source.

TIP: Because of the complexity of transformation mappings, it is often easier
to perform the transformation with a converter or getter and setter
methods of a direct-to-field mapping.

link:#i1054846[Figure 6-7] illustrates a transformation mapping. The
values from the `B_DATE` and `B_TIME` fields are used to create a
`java.util.Date` to be stored in the `birthDate` attribute.

[[i1054846]][[OTLCG92423]]

*_Figure 6-7 Transformation Mappings_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/trmapfig.png[Description of Figure 6-7 follows,title="Description of Figure 6-7 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/trmapfig.adoc[Description of "Figure 6-7 Transformation Mappings"] +

A transformation mapping is made up of the following two components:

* attribute transformer: performs the object attribute transformation at
read time
* field transformer: performs the object attribute-to-field
transformation at write time

You can implement a transformer as either a separate class or as a
method on your domain object.

Often, a transformation mapping is appropriate when values from multiple
fields are used to create an object. This type of mapping requires that
you provide an _attribute transformation_ that is invoked when reading
the object from the database. This must have at least one parameter that
is an instance of `Record`. In your attribute transformation, you can
use `Record` method `get` to retrieve the value in a specific column.
Your attribute transformation can optionally specify a second parameter,
an instance of `Session`. The `Session` performs queries on the database
to get additional values needed in the transformation. The
transformation should _return_ the value to be stored in the attribute.

Transformation mappings also require a _field transformation_ for each
field, to be written to the database when the object is saved. The
transformation returns the value to be stored in that field.

Within your implementation of the attribute and field transformation,
you can take whatever actions are necessary to transform your
application data to suit your data source, and vise versa.

You can perform transformation mappings between database columns and
attribute values by using the `@Transformation` annotation. Use this
annotation with the `@WriteTransformer` and `@ReadTransformer`
annotations. The `@WriteTransformer` annotation is used to transform a
single attribute value to a single database column value. For this
annotation you have the option of providing an implementation of the
`FieldTransformer` interface. For the `@ReadTransformer` annotation, you
must provide an implementation of the
`org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.transformers.AttributeTransformer`
interface. For more information on these annotations, see the
descriptions of the `@Transformation`, `@ReadTransformer`, and
`@WriteTransformer` in _Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) Extensions
Reference for EclipseLink_.
