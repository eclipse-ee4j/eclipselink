==== Descriptor Architecture

A *descriptor* stores all the information describing how an instance of
a particular object class can be represented in a data source. The
Descriptor API can be used to define, or amend EclipseLink descriptors
through Java code. The Descriptor API classes are mainly in the
`org.eclipse.persistence.descriptors` package.

EclipseLink descriptors may contain the following information:

* The persistent Java class it describes and the corresponding data
source (database tables or XML complex type interaction)
* A collection of mappings, which describe how the attributes and
relationships for that class are represented in the data source
* The primary key information (or equivalent) of the data source
* A list of query keys (or aliases) for field names
* Information for sequence numbers
* A set of optional properties for tailoring the behavior of the
descriptor, including support for caching refresh options, identity
maps, optimistic locking, the event manager, and the query manager

There is a descriptor type for each data source type that EclipseLink
supports. In some cases, multiple descriptor types are valid for the
same data source type. The type of descriptor you use determines the
type of mappings that you can define.

[[CHEEDJEH]][[OTLCG92058]]

==== Descriptors and Inheritance

*Inheritance* describes how a derived (child) class inherits the
characteristics of its superclass (parent). You can use descriptors to
describe the inheritance relationships between classes in relational and
XML projects.

In the descriptor for a child class, you can override mappings that have
been specified in the descriptor for a parent class, or map attributes
that have not been mapped at all in the parent class descriptor.

link:#CHEIDEAE[Figure 5-1] illustrates the `Vehicle` object model–a
typical Java inheritance hierarchy. The root class `Vehicle` contains
two branch classes: `FueledVehicle` and `NonFueledVehicle`. Each branch
class contains a leaf class: `Car` and `Bicycle`, respectively.

xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/javainhr.adoc[Description of "Figure 5-1 Example Inheritance Hierarchy "] +

EclipseLink recognizes the following three types of classes in an
inheritance hierarchy:

* The root class stores information about _all_ instantiable classes in
its subclass hierarchy. By default, queries performed on the root class
return instances of the root class and its instantiable subclasses.
However, the root class can be configured so queries on it return only
instances of itself, without instances of its subclasses.
+
For example, the `Vehicle` class in link:#CHEIDEAE[Figure 5-1] is a root
class.
* Branch classes have a persistent superclass and also have subclasses.
By default, queries performed on the branch class return instances of
the branch class and any of its subclasses. However, as with the root
class, the branch class can be configured so queries on it return only
instances of itself without instances of its subclasses.
+
For example, the `FueledVehicle` class in link:#CHEIDEAE[Figure 5-1] is
a branch class.
* Leaf classes have a persistent superclass in the hierarchy but do not
have subclasses. Queries performed on the leaf class can only return
instances of the leaf class.
+
For example, the `Car` class in link:#CHEIDEAE[Figure 5-1] is a leaf
class.

In the descriptor for a child class, you can override mappings that have
been specified in the descriptor for a parent class, or map attributes
that have not been mapped at all in the parent class descriptor.

This section includes information on the following topics:

* link:#CHEEIAEA[Specifying a Class Indicator]
* link:#CHECJEGE[Inheritance and Primary Keys]
* link:#CHEJGFGH[Single and Multi-Table Inheritance]
* link:#CHEEDCIJ[Aggregate and Composite Descriptors and Inheritance]

[[CHEEIAEA]][[OTLCG92071]]

===== Specifying a Class Indicator

When configuring inheritance, you configure the root class descriptor
with the means of determining which subclasses it should instantiate.

You can do this in one of the following ways:

* link:#CHEFDEDA[Using Class Indicator Fields]
* link:#CHEJDAID[Using Class Extraction Methods]

NOTE: All leaf classes in the hierarchy must have a class indicator and they
must have the same type of class indicator (field or class extraction
method).

[[CHEFDEDA]][[OTLCG92072]]

====== Using Class Indicator Fields

You can use a persistent attribute of a class to indicate which subclass
should be instantiated. For example, in a relational descriptor, you can
use a class indicator field in the root class table. The indicator field
should not have an associated direct mapping unless it is set to
read-only.

NOTE: If the indicator field is part of the primary key, define a write-only
transformation mapping for the indicator field.

You can use strings or numbers as values in the class indicator field.

The root class descriptor must specify how the value in the class
indicator field translates into the class to be instantiated.

[[CHEJDAID]][[OTLCG92074]]

====== Using Class Extraction Methods

You can define a Java method to compute the class indicator based on any
available information in the object's data source record. Such a method
is called a class extraction method.

Using a class extraction method, you do not need to include an explicit
class indicator field in your data model and you can handle
relationships that are too complex to describe using class indicator
fields.

A class extraction method must have the following characteristics:

* it must be defined on the root descriptor's class;
* it must be static;
* it must take a `Record` as an argument;
* it must return the `java.lang.Class` object to use for the `Record`
passed in.

You may also need to define only-instances and with-all-subclasses
expressions. If you use a class extraction method, then you must provide
EclipseLink with expressions to correctly filter sibling instances for
all classes that share a common table.

When configuring inheritance using a class extraction method,
EclipseLink does not generate SQL for queries on the root class.

[[CHECJEGE]][[OTLCG92078]]

==== Inheritance and Primary Keys

For relational projects, EclipseLink assumes that all of the classes in
an inheritance hierarchy have the same primary key, as set in the root
descriptor.

[[CHEJGFGH]][[OTLCG92079]]

==== Single and Multi-Table Inheritance

In a relational project, you can map your inheritance hierarchy to a
single table or to multiple tables.

[[CHEEDCIJ]][[OTLCG92080]]

==== Aggregate and Composite Descriptors and Inheritance

You can designate relational descriptors as aggregates. XML descriptors
are always composites (see link:#CHEIIIBJ[Descriptors and Aggregation]).

When configuring inheritance for a relational aggregate descriptor, all
the descriptors in the inheritance tree must be aggregates. The
descriptors for aggregate and non-aggregate classes cannot exist in the
same inheritance tree.

When configuring inheritance for an XML descriptor, because all XML
descriptors are composites, descriptor type does not restrict
inheritance.

[[CHEIIIBJ]][[OTLCG92063]]

==== Descriptors and Aggregation

Two objects—a source (parent or owning) object and a target (child or
owned) object—are related by aggregation if there is a strict one-to-one
relationship between them, and all the attributes of the target object
can be retrieved from the same data source representation as the source
object. This means that if the source object exists, then the target
object must also exist, and if the source object is destroyed, then the
target object is also destroyed.

In this case, the descriptors for the source and target objects must be
designated to reflect this relationship.

The EJB 3.0 specification does not support nested aggregates).

[[CACGEBJF]][[OTLCG00184]]

==== Descriptor Customization

You can customize a descriptor at run time by specifying a descriptor
customizer—a Java class that implements the
`org.eclipse.persistence.config.DescriptorCustomizer` interface and
provides a default (zero-argument) constructor.

You use a descriptor customizer to customize a descriptor at run time
through code API similar to how you use an amendment method to customize
a descriptor. See link:#CHEIGIHG[Amendment Methods].

[[CHEIGIHG]][[OTLCG00186]]

==== Amendment Methods

You can associate a static Java method that is called when a descriptor
is loaded at run time. This method can amend the run-time descriptor
instance through the descriptor Java code API. The method must be
`public` `static` and take a single parameter of type
`org.persistence.descriptors.structures.ClassDescriptor`. In the
implementation of this method, you can configure advanced features of
the descriptor using any of the public descriptor and mapping API.

You can only modify descriptors before the session has been connected;
you should not modify descriptors after the session has been connected.

Amendment methods can be used with rational descriptors,
object-relational data type descriptors, and XML descriptors.

[[CHEDDDJF]][[OTLCG00050]]

==== Descriptor Event Manager

In relational projects, EclipseLink raises various instances of
`DescriptorEvent` during the persistence life cycle. Each descriptor
owns an instance of `DescriptorEventManager` that is responsible for
receiving these events and dispatching them to the descriptor event
handlers registered with it.

Using a descriptor event handler, you can execute your own application
specific logic whenever descriptor events occur, allowing you to take
customized action at various points in the persistence life-cycle. For
example, using a descriptor event handler, you can do the following:

* Synchronize persistent objects with other systems, services, and
frameworks
* Maintain nonpersistent attributes of which EclipseLink is not aware
* Notify other objects in the application when the persistent state of
an object changes
* Implement complex mappings or optimizations not directly supported by
EclipseLink mappings
