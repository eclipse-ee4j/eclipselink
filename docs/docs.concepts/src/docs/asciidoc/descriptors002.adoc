=== Object-Relational Descriptor Concepts

The following sections describe the concepts specific to
Object-Relational descriptors.

* link:#CHEJJCCG[Fetch Groups]
* link:#CHEFCCBD[Descriptor Query Manager]
* link:#CHECGEFD[Descriptors and Sequencing]
* link:#CHEEEIEA[Descriptors and Locking]

[[CHEJJCCG]][[OTLCG92062]]

==== Fetch Groups

By default, when you execute an object-level read query for a particular
object class, EclipseLink returns all the persistent attributes mapped
in the object's descriptor. With this single query, all the object's
persistent attributes are defined, and calling their `get` methods
returns the value directly from the object.

When you are interested in only some of the attributes of an object, it
may be more efficient to return only a subset of the object's attributes
using a fetch group.

Using a fetch group, you can define a subset of an object's attributes
and associate the fetch group with either a `ReadObjectQuery` or
`ReadAllQuery` query. When you execute the query, EclipseLink retrieves
only the attributes in the fetch group. EclipseLink automatically
executes a query to fetch all the attributes excluded from this subset
when and if you call a get method on any one of the excluded attributes.

You can define more than one fetch group for a class. You can optionally
designate at most one such fetch group as the default fetch group. If
you execute either a `ReadObjectQuery` or `ReadAllQuery` query without
specifying a fetch group, EclipseLink will use the default fetch group,
unless you configure the query otherwise.

Before using fetch groups, Oracle recommends that you perform a careful
analysis of system use. In many cases, the extra queries required to
load attributes not in the fetch group could well offset the gain from
the partial attribute loading.

Fetch groups can be used only with basic mappings configured with
`FetchType.LAZY (partial object queries)`.

EclipseLink uses the `AttributeGroup` that can be used to configure the
use of partial entities in fetch, load, copy, and merge operations.

* Fetch: Control which attributes and their associated columns are
retrieved from the database
* Load: Control which relationships in the entities returned from a
query are populated
* Copy: Control which attributes are copied into a new entity instance
* Merge: Merge only those attributes fetched, loaded, or copied into an
entity

[[sthref27]]

==== AttributeGroup Types and Operations

The following sections describe the possible `AttributeGroup` types and
operations.

* link:#CHDCHCHI[FetchGroup]
* link:#CHDBHDBG[Default FetchGroup]
* link:#CHDDIGEH[Named FetchGroup]
* link:#CHDHFEIB[Full FetchGroup]
* link:#CHDFADCE[Load/LoadAll with FetchGroup]
* link:#CHDJHHGD[LoadGroup]
* link:#CHDCJDIE[CopyGroup]
* link:#CHDIIBAJ[Merging]

[[CHDCHCHI]]

==== FetchGroup

The `FetchGroup` defines which attributes should be fetched (selected
from the database) when the entity is retrieved as the result of a query
execution. The inclusion of relationship attributes in a `FetchGroup`
only determines if the attribute's required columns should be fetched
and populated. In the case of a lazy fetch type the inclusion of the
attribute simply means that its proxy will be created to enable lazy
loading when accessed. To force a relationship mapping to be populated
when using a `FetchGroup` on a query the attribute must be included in
the group and must either be `FetchType.EAGER` or it must be included in
an associated `LoadGroup` on the query.

[[CHDBHDBG]]

==== Default FetchGroup

`FetchGroup` also has the notion of named and default `FetchGroup` which
are managed by the `FetchGroupManager`. A default `FetchGroup` is
defined during metadata processing if one or more basic mappings are
configured to be lazy and the entity class implements
`FetchGroupTracker` (typically introduced through weaving). The default
`FetchGroup` is used on all queries for this entity type where no
explicit `FetchGroup` or named `FetchGroup` is configured.

[[CHDDIGEH]]

==== Named FetchGroup

A named `FetchGroup` can be defined for an entity using `@FetchGroup`
annotation or within the `eclipselink-orm.xml` file.

[[CHDHFEIB]]

==== Full FetchGroup

A `FetchGroup` when first created is assumed to be empty. The user must
add the attributes to the `FetchGroup`. If a `FetchGroup` is required
with all of the attributes then the
`FetchGroupManager.createFullFetchGroup()` must be used.

[[CHDFADCE]]

==== Load/LoadAll with FetchGroup

A `FetchGroup` can also be configured to perform a load operation of
relationship mappings and nested relationship mappings.

[[CHDJHHGD]]

==== LoadGroup

A `LoadGroup` is used to force a specified set of relationship
attributes to be populated in a query result.

[[CHDCJDIE]]

==== CopyGroup

The `CopyGroup` replaces the deprecated `ObjectCopyPolicy` being used to
define how a entity is copied. In addition to specifying the attributes
defining what should be copied from the source entity graph into the
target copy the `CopyGroup` also allows definition of:

* `shouldResetPrimaryKey`: Reset the identifier attributes to their
default value. This is used when the copy operation is intended to clone
the entity in order to make a new entity with similar state to the
source. Default is `false`.
* `shouldResetVersion`: Reset the optimistic version locking attribute
to its default value in the copies. Default is `false`.
* `depth`: defines cascade mode for handling relationships. By default
`CASCADE_PRIVATE_PARTS` is used but it can also be configured to
`NO_CASCADE` and `CASCADE_ALL_PARTS`.

[[CHDIIBAJ]]

==== Merging

When a partial entity is merged into a persistence context that has an
`AttributeGroup` associated with it defining which attributes are
available only those attributes are merged. The relationship mappings
within the entity are still merged according to their cascade merge
settings.

[[CHEFCCBD]][[OTLCG92064]]

==== Descriptor Query Manager

Each relational descriptor provides an instance of
`DescriptorQueryManager` that you can use to configure the following:

* named queries
* custom default queries for basic persistence operations
* additional join expressions

[[CHECGEFD]][[OTLCG92065]]

==== Descriptors and Sequencing

An essential part of maintaining object identity is managing the
assignment of unique values (that is, a specific sequence) to
distinguish one object instance from another.

Sequencing options you configure at the project (or session) level
determine the type of sequencing that EclipseLink uses. In a POJO
project, you can use session-level sequence configuration to override
project-level sequence configuration, on a session-by-session basis, if
required.

After configuring the sequence type, for each descriptor's reference
class, you must associate one attribute, typically the attribute used as
the primary key, with its own sequence.

[[CHEEEIEA]][[OTLCG00086]]

==== Descriptors and Locking

With object-relational mapping, you can configure a descriptor with any
of the following locking policies to control concurrent access to a
domain object:

* Optimistic—All users have read access to the data. When a user
attempts to make a change, the application checks to ensure the data has
not changed since the user read the data.
* Pessimistic—The first user who accesses the data with the purpose of
updating it locks the data until completing the update.
* No locking—The application does not prevent users overwriting each
other's changes.

Oracle recommends using optimistic locking for most types of
applications to ensure that users do not overwrite each other's changes.

This section describes the various types of locking policies that
EclipseLink supports, including the following:

* link:#CIHJCGBA[Optimistic Version Locking Policies]
* link:#CIHCFBJG[Pessimistic Locking Policies]
* link:#BCGDJHAF[Applying Locking in an Application]

[[CIHJCGBA]][[OTLCG00029]]

==== Optimistic Version Locking Policies

With optimistic locking, all users have read access to the data. When a
user attempts to make a change, the application checks to ensure the
data has not changed since the user read the data.

Optimistic version locking policies enforce optimistic locking by using
a version field (also known as a write-lock field) that you provide in
the reference class that EclipseLink updates each time an object change
is committed.

EclipseLink caches the value of this version field as it reads an object
from the data source. When the client attempts to write the object,
EclipseLink compares the cached version value with the current version
value in the data source in the following way:

* If the values are the same, EclipseLink updates the version field in
the object and commits the changes to the data source.
* If the values are different, the write operation is disallowed because
another client must have updated the object since this client initially
read it.

EclipseLink provides the following version-based optimistic locking
policies:

* `VersionLockingPolicy`
* `TimestampLockingPolicy`

For descriptions of these locking policies, see "Setting Optimistic
Locking" in _Solutions Guide for EclipseLink_.

NOTE: In general, Oracle recommends numeric version locking because of the
following:

* accessing the timestamp from the data source can have a negative
impact on performance;
* time stamp locking is limited to the precision that the database
stores for timestamps.

Whenever any update fails because optimistic locking has been violated,
EclipseLink throws an `OptimisticLockException`. This should be handled
by the application when performing any database modification. The
application must notify the client of the locking contention, refresh
the object, and have the client reapply its changes.

You can choose to store the version value in the object as a mapped
attribute, or in the cache. In three-tier applications, you typically
store the version value in the object to ensure it is passed to the
client when updated (see link:#BCGDJHAF[Applying Locking in an
Application]).

If you store the version value in the cache, you do not need to map it.
If you do map the version field, you must configure the mapping as
read-only.

To ensure that the parent object's version field is updated whenever a
privately owned child object is modified, consider
link:#CHECICGH[Optimistic Version Locking Policies and Cascading].

If you are using a stored procedure to update or delete an object, your
database may not return the row-count required to detect an optimistic
lock failure, so your stored procedure is responsible for checking the
optimistic lock version and throwing an error if they do not match. Only
version locking is directly supported with a `StoredProcedureCall`.
Because timestamp and field locking require two versions of the same
field to be passed to the call, an SQL call that uses an `##` parameter
to access the translation row could be used for other locking policies.

[[CHECICGH]][[OTLCG92082]]

===== Optimistic Version Locking Policies and Cascading

If your database schema is such that both a parent object and its
privately owned child object are stored in the same table, then if you
update the child object, the parent object's version field will be
updated.

However, if the parent and its privately owned child are stored in
separate tables, then changing the child will not, by default, update
the parent's version field.

To ensure that the parent object's version field is updated in this
case, you can either manually update the parent object's version field
or, if you are using a `VersionLockingPolicy`, you can configure
EclipseLink to automatically cascade the child object's version field
update to the parent.

After you enable optimistic version locking cascading, when a privately
owned child object is modified, EclipseLink will traverse the privately
owned foreign reference mappings, updating all the parent objects back
to the root.

EclipseLink supports optimistic version locking cascading for:

* object changes in privately owned one-to-one and one-to-many mappings
* relationship changes (adding or removing) in the following collection
mappings (privately owned or not):
** direct collection
** one-to-many
** many-to-many
** aggregate collection

Consider the example object graph shown in link:#CHEEBGIH[Figure 5-2]

[[CHEEBGIH]][[OTLCG92083]]

*_Figure 5-2 Optimistic Version Locking Policies and Cascading Example_*

image:{imagesrelativedir}/oplckcas.png[Description of Figure 5-2 follows,title="Description of Figure 5-2 follows"] +
xref:{imagestextrelativedir}/oplckcas.adoc[Description of "Figure 5-2 Optimistic Version Locking Policies and Cascading Example"] +

In this example, `ObjectA` privately owns `ObjectB`, and `ObjectB`
privately owns `ObjectC`, and `ObjectC` privately owns `ObjectD`.

Suppose you register `ObjectB` in a unit of work, modify an `ObjectB`
field, and commit the unit of work. In this case, `ObjectB` checks the
cache for `ObjectA` and, if not present, queries the database for
`ObjectA`. `ObjectB` then notifies `ObjectA` of its change. `ObjectA`
forces an update on its version optimistic locking field even though it
has no changes to its corresponding table.

Suppose you register `ObjectA` in a unit of work, access its `ObjectB`
to access its `ObjectC` to access its `ObjectD`, modify an `ObjectD`
field, and commit the unit of work. In this case, `ObjectD` notifies
`ObjectC` of its changes. `ObjectC` forces an update on its version
optimistic locking field even though it has no changes to its
corresponding table. `ObjectC` then notifies `ObjectB` of the `ObjectD`
change. `ObjectB` then notifies `ObjectA` of the `ObjectD` change.
`ObjectA` forces an update on its version optimistic locking field even
though it has no changes to its corresponding table.

[[CACIAHGG]][[OTLCG92084]]

===== Optimistic Locking and Rollbacks

With optimistic locking, use the `UnitOfWork` method
`commitAndResumeOnFailure` to rollback a locked object's value, if you
store the optimistic lock versions in the cache.

If you store the locked versions in an object, you must refresh the
objects (or their versions) on a failure. Alternatively, you can acquire
a new unit of work on the failure and reapply any changes into the new
unit of work.

[[CIHCFEIB]][[OTLCG92085]]

===== Optimistic Field Locking Policies

Optimistic field locking policies enforce optimistic locking by using
one or more of the fields that currently exist in the table to determine
if the object has changed since the client read the object.

The unit of work caches the original state of the object when you first
read the object or register it with the unit of work. At commit time,
the unit of work compares the original values of the lock fields with
their current values on the data source during the update. If any of the
lock fields' values have changed, an optimistic lock exception is
thrown.

EclipseLink provides the following optimistic field locking policies:

* `AllFieldsLockingPolicy`
* `ChangedFieldsLockingPolicy`
* `SelectedFieldsLockingPolicy`
* `VersionLockingPolicy`
* `TimestampLockingPolicy`

For descriptions of these locking policies, see "Setting Optimistic
Locking" in _Solutions Guide for EclipseLink_.

[[CIHCFBJG]][[OTLCG92086]]

==== Pessimistic Locking Policies

With pessimistic locking, the first user who accesses the data with the
purpose of updating it locks the data until completing the update.

When using a pessimistic locking policy, you can configure the policy to
either fail immediately or to wait until the read lock is acquired.

You can use a pessimistic locking policy only in a project with a
container-managed persistence type and with descriptors that have EJB
information.

You can also use pessimistic locking (but not a pessimistic locking
policy) at the query level.

EclipseLink provides an optimization for pessimistic locking when this
locking is used with entities with container-managed persistence: if you
set your query to pessimistic locking and run the query in its own new
transaction (which will end after the execution of the finder), then
EclipseLink overrides the locking setting and does not append
`FOR UPDATE` to the SQL. However, the use of this optimization may
produce an undesirable result if the pessimistic lock query has been
customized by the user with a SQL string that includes `FOR` `UPDATE`.
In this case, if the conditions for the optimization are present, the
query will be reset to nonpessimistic locking, but the SQL will remain
the same resulting in the locking setting of the query conflicting with
the query's SQL string. To avoid this problem, you can take one of the
following two approaches:

* Use an expression (see link:expressions.htm#CHDCAIGD[Chapter 10,
"Understanding EclipseLink Expressions"]) for the selection criteria.
This will give EclipseLink control over the SQL generation.
* Place the finder in a transaction to eliminate conditions for the
optimization.

[[BCGDJHAF]][[OTLCG92087]]

==== Applying Locking in an Application

To correctly lock an object in an application, you must obtain the lock
before the object is sent to the client for editing.

[[CHEHDAEH]][[OTLCG92088]]

[[BCGCBAFE]]

===== Applying Optimistic Locking in an Application

If you are using optimistic locking, you have the following two choices
for locking objects correctly:

* Map the optimistic lock field in your object as not read-only and pass
the version to the client on the read and back to the server on the
update.
+
Ensure that the original version value is sent to the client when it
reads the object for the update. The client must then pass the original
version value back with the update information, and this version must be
set into the object to be updated after it is registered/read in the new
unit of work on the server.
* Hold the unit of work for the duration of the interaction with the
client.
+
Either through a stateful session bean, or in an HTTP session, store the
unit of work used to read the object for the update for the duration of
the client interaction.
+
You must read the object through this unit of work before passing it to
the client for the update. This ensures that the version value stored in
the unit of work cache or in the unit of work clone will be the original
value.
+
This same unit of work must be used for the update.

The first option is more commonly used, and is required if developing a
stateless application.

[[OTLCG92089]]

[[sthref29]]

===== Applying Pessimistic Locking in an Application

If you are using pessimistic locking, you must use the unit of work to
start a database transaction before the object is read. You must hold
this unit of work and database transaction while the client is editing
the object and until the client updates the object. You must use this
same unit of work to update the object.
