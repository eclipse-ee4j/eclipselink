This figure illustrates process in an MOXy project. The starting point
is an XML schema. A binding compiler binds the source schema to a set of
schema-derived program classes and interfaces. JAXB-annotated classes
within the application are generated either by a schema compiler or the
result of a developer adding JAXB annotations to existing Java classes.
The application can either marshal data to an XML document or unmarshal
the data to a tree of content objects.
