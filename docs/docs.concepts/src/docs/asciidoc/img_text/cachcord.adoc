This figure illustrates multiple JVMs running more than one persistence
unit (session) cache. Any changes to a cache sends a change notification
to the cache coordination software. These changes are broadcast to
multiple, possibly distributed, instances of a session so that each
session's cache is either kept up-to-date or notified that the cache
must update an object from the data source the next time it is read.
