=== About Cache Coordination

The need to maintain up-to-date data for all applications is a key
design challenge for building a distributed application. The difficulty
of this increases as the number of servers within an environment
increases. EclipseLink provides a distributed cache coordination feature
that ensures data in distributed applications remains current.

Cache coordination reduces the number of optimistic lock exceptions
encountered in a distributed architecture, and decreases the number of
failed or repeated transactions in an application. However, cache
coordination in no way eliminates the need for an effective locking
policy. To effectively ensure working with up-to-date data, cache
coordination must be used with optimistic or pessimistic locking. Oracle
recommends that you use cache coordination with an optimistic locking
policy.

Tune the EclipseLink cache for each class to help eliminate the need for
distributed cache coordination. Always tune these settings before
implementing cache coordination. For more information, see "Monitoring
and Optimizing EclipseLink-Enabled Applications" in _Solutions Guide for
EclipseLink_.

You can use cache invalidation to improve cache coordination efficiency.
For more information, see "Setting Entity Caching Expiration" in
_Solutions Guide for EclipseLink_.

As link:#CDEIJFHB[Figure 8-2] shows, cache coordination is a session
feature that allows multiple, possibly distributed, instances of a
session to broadcast object changes among each other so that each
session's cache is either kept up-to-date or notified that the cache
must update an object from the data source the next time it is read.

NOTE: You cannot use isolated client sessions with cache coordination. For
more information, see xref:#CDEEGICF[Shared, Isolated,
Protected, Weak, and Read-only Caches.]

When sessions are distributed, that is, when an application contains
multiple sessions (in the same JVM, in multiple JVMs, possibly on
different servers), as long as the servers hosting the sessions are
interconnected on the network, sessions can participate in cache
coordination. Coordinated cache types that require discovery services
also require the servers to support User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
communication and multicast configuration. For more information, see
xref:#CHDCJEFJ[Coordinating JMS and RMI Caches.]

==== When to Use Cache Coordination

Cache coordination can enhance performance and reduce the likelihood of
stale data for applications that have the following characteristics:

* Changes are all being performed by the same Java application operating
with multiple, distributed sessions
* Primarily read-based
* Regularly requests and updates the same objects

To maximize performance, avoid cache coordination for applications that
do not have these characteristics.

For other options to reduce the likelihood of stale data, see
xref:#CACHE004[About Handling Stale Data.]
